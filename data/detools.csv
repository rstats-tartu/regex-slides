Libraries for RNAseq analysis were generated using the SMART-seq2 kit (Clontech) and reads obtained by Illumina sequencing. The total number of reads per gene was determined by mapping the reads to the S. mansoni genome using STAR (version 020201) (Dobin et al., 2013). S. mansoni genome sequence and GTF files used for mapping were acquired from Wormbase Parasite (Howe et al., 2017). Pairwise comparisons of differential gene expression were performed with DESeq2 (version 1.12.2) (Love et al., 2014). To determine which genes showed the highest level of enrichment in the various cell populations we also performed Model Based clustering using the MBCluster.seq package in R (Si et al., 2014). This clustering analysis was only performed on genes that had more than 200 total reads from the Neoblast, TSP-2+, and IR-REST cell populations.

Briefly, total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy Minikits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Next, RNA integrity and concentration were assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) and Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, respectively. After that, cDNA libraries were generated using a SciClone NGS Library Production Robot (Perkin Elmer) and library quality was verified using the Agilent Bioanalyzer. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was subsequently performed using an Illumina HiSeq2500 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to achieve single 100 base pair reads with a read depths of 15–20 million reads per sample. Short raw sequence reads were downloaded from the HiSeq2500 server in FASTQ format and individually mapped to the human reference genome (hg38) using TopHat. The complete bioinformatics analysis pipeline for the RNAseq data was performed using the Tuxedo protocol, which includes TopHat, Cufflinks, Cuffmerge, and Cuffdiff (22). Differential gene expression analysis results from the Cufflinks analysis of individual samples were reported as Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million Mapped reads (FPKM) which reports the normalized expression values for a given gene and accounts for multiple reads for an individual fragment. Transcripts up- and downregulated relative to controls were considered significantly changed only when the false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value (q-value) was <0.05. Relative differences in gene expression were assessed by comparing the log2-fold change values between the islet FPKMs for bacteria-treated and time-matched controls.

DNase-treated total RNA (300ng) was depleted of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) using appropriate probes provided by Illumina and further assessed on the bio-analyzer to confirm 18S and 28S rRNA peaks are depleted. rRNA-depleted RNA is processed using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA sample prep kit. Briefly, RNA samples are chemically fragmented in a buffer containing divalent cations and heating at 94°C for 8 min. The fragmented RNA is random hexamer primed and reverse transcribed to generate first strand cDNA. The second strand is synthesized after removing the RNA template and incorporating dUTP in place of dTTP. cDNA is then end repaired and adenylated at their 3′ ends. A corresponding ‘T’ nucleotide on the adaptors is utilized for ligating the adaptor sequences to the cDNA. The adaptor ligated DNA is purified using magnetic Ampure XP beads and PCR amplified using 12–13 cycles to generate the final libraries. The final libraries are size selected and purified using 1.0 × Ampure XP beads to remove any primer dimers. The final library size is typically 200–600bp with insert sizes ranging from 80–450bp. Final libraries are validated using bioanalyzer DNA chips and qPCR quantified using primers recognizing the Illumina adaptors. Libraries are pooled at equimolar ratios, quantified using qPCR (quantification of only the adaptor-ligated libraries) and loaded onto the NextSeq 500 flow cell at 1.8pM final concentration for pair end 75bp reads. 20–25 million mappable reads per sample were collected.

Sequencing libraries were constructed using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq with a read length of 51 nt (single end, reverse stranded). Output sequencing read quality was analyzed using the Seqtk (version 1.2) and fastx_toolkit (version 0.0.14) software tools and used without further processing. The reads were mapped to the Ensembl human genome assembly GRCh37 (also known as hg19) using Tophat2 (version 2.0.12; Bowtie version 2.2.7) with first-strand library type, no novel junctions, and otherwise default options. Mapped reads were counted using featureCounts (from subread version 1.4.6) with default options. Statistical analysis was performed using a count-based workflow50 with the edgeR Bioconductor package (version 3.12.1). In brief, gene counts were normalized to counts per million reads and genes with <10–15 mapped reads were filtered out. Transcriptome composition bias between samples was eliminated using edgeR’s default trimmed mean of M-values normalization. Differential expression analyses were performed using edgeR’s quantile-adjusted conditional maximum likelihood method."
29234000,limma,"The majority of MØ research has been performed using cultured cell lines and/or in vitro-derived BMDM. Accordingly, precise mechanisms of how cells meet metabolic demands in vivo remain unknown, making it critical to assess cell function in conjunction with tissue-niche metabolites. The peritoneum contains pTRMØ that are readily recovered without disruptive tissue digestion, limiting alterations of in vivo-characteristics. We performed gas chromatography-time-of-flight metabolite analysis to determine metabolic differences between macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF)-derived BMDM, the standard model for macrophage functional analysis, and pTRMØ. Analysis revealed a stark contrast, with many metabolites having statistically significant differences (Two-way ANOVA post-tests p < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 1; Supplementary Data 1); however, unbiased ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) described enrichment of tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-associated metabolites (Fig. 1a) and lower amino acids in pTRMØ compared to BMDM (Supplementary Fig. 1). Given these differences, we next compared their RNA expression. RNA-sequencing revealed expected contrasts in gene expression, although surprisingly, IPA analysis did not identify metabolic pathways as differentially regulated (Supplementary Fig. 2). However, there were statistically significant differences in many metabolic genes (Limma-Voom-paired tests, p < 0.05). This involved alternate expression of genes within the same metabolic pathways, including different isoform expression between the populations (Supplementary Fig. 3); explaining the lack of IPA identification. Together, these data support that pTRMØ may have greater mitochondrial activity than BMDM and perhaps deplete amino acids to support this. To assess mitochondrial function, we quantified oxygen consumption rates (OCR) during mitochondrial stress tests (Fig. 1b, c). Interestingly, basal-OCR was comparable, however maximal mitochondrial capacity was greater in pTRMØ (Fig. 1c, d), despite similar mitochondrial quantification (Fig. 1e). Accordingly, we analysed mitochondrial volume in individual MØs (Supplementary Movies 1–4). Mitochondrial morphology, volumes and numbers were heterogeneous (Supplementary Fig. 4a), although on average pTRMØ had fewer, but larger mitochondrial networks (Supplementary Fig. 4b), resulting in similar total mitochondrial volumes (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Collectively, this demonstrates that pTRMØ have similar mitochondrial volume but higher OXPHOS during metabolic stress, indicating greater mitochondrial efficiency23. Furthermore, pTRMØ exhibited higher extracellular acidification rates (ECAR), an indicator of glycolytic activity (Fig. 1b, d).

31560831,sleuth,"The above in situ data suggest that there is a sharp change in the expression patterns from 3 to 4 dpi. Thus, to capture the genome‐wide gene expression changes caused by the advancing virus infection, we collected meristem tissue samples from 4 dpi mock‐ and CymRSV‐infected plants in four biological replicates (45 meristems for each replicate) for transcriptome analysis. RNA extraction was performed as described previously (Burgyán et al., 2000). It is important to note that these samples contained not only meristem cells but tissues close to the meristem, as indicated in Fig. ​Fig.2.2. Using the purified RNAs, we prepared polyA‐selected, unstranded sequencing libraries and sequenced them on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform with a 75 bp single‐end chemistry. The alignment of the sequences to the N. benthamiana v. 1.0.1 reference transcriptome and the differential expression analysis was carried out with kallisto and sleuth, respectively (Pimentel et al., 2017). For the criteria considering a transcript as differentially expressed see the legend of Fig. S2. Applying the filtering rules we identified 5747 significantly up‐regulated and 4369 down‐regulated transcripts (Fig. S2 and Table S1A,B). We checked the expression pattern of some marker genes and potentially meristem‐specific genes in the sequencing data (Fig. S3). We verified the results of the sequencing data by RT‐qPCR (Fig. S4). We also checked the expression of the known meristem‐specific genes (Fig. S5 and Table S1C). To characterize the transcriptional changes functionally, we performed Gene Ontology (GO)‐term enrichment analysis of the significantly changed genes using PlantRegMap (Jin et al., 2017) and REVIGO (Supek et al., 2011). Analysing the results in detail, we can conclude that the up‐regulated genes are mainly related to cell defence (plasma membrane‐located receptor kinases, hypersensitive response, salicylic acid and ethylene signalling, programmed cell death; Fig. ​Fig.44 and Table S2A), while the down‐regulated genes are related to DNA replication and organization, shoot meristem development and plasmodesmata function (Fig. ​(Fig.44 and Table S2B)."

The cells were purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (see MATERIAL AND METHODS, Figure 1A–1D). The germline stem cells were evaluated by the following experiments. Firstly, we determined the expression of Mvh (mouse vasa homolog, also termed DEAD box polypeptide 4, Ddx4) [46], Dazl (deleted in azoospermia-like) [47, 48], Fragilis (also termed interferon induced transmembrane protein 3, Ifitm3) [49], Oct4 (organic cation/carnitine transporter4, also termed POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1, Pou5f1) [50], Stella (also termed developmental pluripotency-associated 3, Dppa3) [49, 51] and Blimp1 (also termed PR domain containing 1, with ZNF domain, Prdm1) [52] in SSCs and FGSCs that we isolated using RT-PCR analysis. The results showed that the cells express Mvh, Dazl, Fragilis, Oct4, Stella and Blimp1 (Supplementary Figure 2A). Secondly, immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the expression of Mvh, Oct4 and Dazl (Supplementary Figure 2B and 2C). Thirdly, based on the results from our previous study, we further checked eighteen stemness genes expression in isolated SSCs and FGSCs [6]. Using RT-PCR analysis, all of the eighteen stemness genes were expressed in both isolated SSCs and FGSCs (Supplementary Figure 2D). And lastly, immunofluorescence analysis of EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) incorporation demonstrated that both isolated SSCs and FGSCs possessed proliferative ability and SSCs and FGSCs that we isolated contained same portion (> 90%) of the truly germlien stem cells (Figure 1E–1J). All the characteristics detected clearly demonstrate both SSCs and FGSCs that we isolated possessed germ cell and stem cell characteristics.

RNA-seq reads from three biological replicates for the wild type and mutant were mapped to the maize reference genome (AGPv2) and used to quantify expression of 39,656 high-confidence filtered gene set (FGS) gene models (ZmB73v5b.60; gramene.org; Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Data Set 2). Using the DESeq software (Anders and Huber, 2010), we identified 422 differentially expressed (DE) genes (P < 0.05); 283 DE genes were upregulated in fea4 mutants, and 172 were downregulated (Supplemental Data Set 3). Downregulated genes were highly enriched for biological processes related to multicellular development (GO:0007275, P = 2.77e-05), transcriptional regulation (GO:0006355; P = 0.002), and response to hormone stimulus (GO:0009725, P = 0.008) (Supplemental Data Set 4). Many downregulated genes in fea4 mutants were key regulators of axillary meristem identity and determinacy in maize, such as BARREN STALK1 (BA1), RAMOSA1 (RA1), and RA3. In addition, homeobox transcription factors (TFs), notably HD-ZIPs, were significantly downregulated in fea4 mutants, as were genes involved in response to auxin stimulus (GO:0009733, P = 0.005), including a number of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) TFs (Table 2). Upregulated genes in fea4 mutants were enriched for biological processes related to translation (GO:0006412, P = 4.12e-09) as well as cellular biosynthetic (GO:0044249, P = 2.05e-06) and metabolic processes, e.g., sugar metabolism (GO:0005996, P = 1.04e-04; GO:0006006, P = 8.82e-04) (Supplemental Data Sets 3 and 4). Interestingly, a panel of 18 meristem marker genes, comprising CLV and WUS-related genes, as well as additional genes defined by fasciated ear mutants, showed no significant changes in gene expression (Supplemental Table 3), supporting our genetic data that suggest FEA4 acts in parallel to CLV-WUS signaling."

23950727,deseq,"The DeSeq variance analysis package [49] was used to identify genes that were downregulated by ≥4-fold with an adjusted p-value of ≤0.05 in the spo0A
− strain relative to wild type. This pair-wise analysis identified 276 genes as being Spo0A-dependent (Table S3). Consistent with the role of Spo0A as the master regulator of sporulation, 65 of these genes were predicted to be involved in sporulation (Table S4) [11], [50]–[52]. Six of these Spo0A-dependent genes were recently identified as encoding components of the C. difficile spore coat [50], [53], and 36 sporulation-related genes (Table S4) were shown to depend on σH, the stationary phase sigma factor that induces spo0A transcription in C. difficile
[51] and B. subtilis
[54]. σF-, σE-, σG-, and σK-dependent genes were identified by comparing the transcriptional profiles of the sigF−, sigE−, sigG−, and sigK− strains to wild type, respectively, using the same parameters as above. This analysis identified 183 genes as being dependent on σF for their expression (Table S5). One hundred eighteen of these σF-dependent genes were also σE-dependent (Table S6), indicating that σE has some activity in a sigF− mutant consistent with the reduced levels of cleaved σE being detected by Western blot (Figure 2); 29 of the σF-dependent genes formed a separate subset of genes that were also σG-dependent but σE-independent. Indeed, the majority of the 34 σG-dependent genes identified in this analysis were not dependent on σE for their expression (Table S7), since only four of the σG-regulated genes were also σE-regulated. Notably, none of the genes identified as being σG-dependent required σK for their expression (Table S8), suggesting that the σG produced in the sigE− and sigK− mutants is active (Figure 2). This result differs from the B. subtilis model where σE is needed to fully activate σG function [20], [21], [46], [55], [56]."

32968084,limma,"We employed tandem mass tag LC–MS/MS protein mass spectrometry to characterize liver protein content of Eef2 knockdown mice. Seven, nine, and twelve days post-injection time points were chosen based on the pattern of the factor VII activity and transcriptomic analysis of the corresponding animals. Luciferase siRNA injected mice were used as a control group. Three replicates of control mice and three replicates of siRNA treated mice were compared with each other. The grand total of 1996 proteins were included in the analysis after passing quality filters and at least two unique peptides per protein requirement (Supplementary Data 3). The differential expression analysis was conducted with limma package in R. The first time point (7 days) yielded less than 30 differentially regulated proteins indicating a very early response to the Eef2 knockdown, consistent with the decline of serum factor VII (Fig. 3A). At the next time point (day 9) a total of 34 proteins were found upregulated and 18 downregulated (Benjamini–Hochberg corrected p-value < 0.05). eEF2 served as a positive internal control as it appeared at the top of the downregulated proteins both by the fold change and the p-value. As the number of differentially regulated proteins was low and the majority of proteins did not exceed 1.5-fold change (Fig. 3D), we did not impose any additional thresholds and cut-offs. Strikingly, among the 34 upregulated proteins 24 were ribosomal proteins from both small and large subunits as can be seen in STRING visualization (Supplementary Fig. S9). During the progression of knockdown from 9 to 12 days, the cluster of upregulated ribosomal proteins became even larger. We also detected two other eukaryotic elongation factors eEF1a1 and eEF1b among upregulated proteins. Two other interesting translation-related proteins appeared upregulated—BTF3 and LARP1. BTF3 is the general transcription inhibitor, but it has an important secondary function as a component of the nascent polypeptide associated complex (NAC). LARP1 functions downstream of mTORC1 and regulates translation of 5′ TOP motif-containing mRNAs. Taken together, these observations indicate that the subset of transcripts encoding translation machinery components is the main target of the knockdown. Most of the transcripts of ribosomal proteins, elongation and some initiation factors contain TOP motifs, therefore the tight upregulation of the entire cluster of ribosomal proteins can be attributed to mTOR, 4E-BP1 and LARP1 pathway. Furthermore, as mRNAs encoding the mitochondrial ribosome proteins lack TOP motif, they were not upregulated or repressed by the translation elongation factor knockdown (Fig. 3D). To further investigate the effect of Eef2 knockdown, we performed GSEA on the same set of proteomics data. Genes were pre-ranked using the signed logarithm of the p-value provided as an output from the differential gene expression analysis. GSEA clearly supported upregulation of genes involved in translation, ribosomal biogenesis, mRNA and ncRNA metabolism. Pretty much every gene encoding the cytosolic ribosome was enriched in the knockdown phenotype based on the GSEA analysis (Fig. 3C,D). There was a very strong enrichment of related GO categories (Fig. 3B). Gene sets enriched among downregulated genes were less conclusive with the prevalence of secretory pathways and exocytosis categories, which is not surprising given the general decline in liver function and progressing signs of factor VII depletion in the serum (Fig. 2E, Supplementary Table S1)."

Quality control checks on raw sequencing data for each sample were performed using FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics). Reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome (mm10) using STAR (version 3.4.0)58. Subsequently the analysis was performed with R Bioconductor packages:59 Rsamtools (version 1.18.3) and GenomicAlignments (version 1.2.2) were used to count the reads by exons, and gene count datasets were then analyzed to determine DE genes (DEGs) using DESeq2 (version 1.16.1). A gene was determined to be a DEG by passing FDR < 0.1 and log 2-fold change ≥ ±0.5."

Sequencing files were converted to fastq files and demultiplexed using CASAVA 1.8.0. Data quality was queried using a suite of custom perl and R scripts to calculate the mean quality score at each position read, as well as calculate the relative abundance of each nucleotide. Following quality control, sequences were trimmed for adaptor sequence and were matched to ensure that the same read was present in both the forward and reverse fastq files. Data analysis was performed using the Tuxedo suite of programs, which includes Tophat to map reads against the Bowtie build index of NCBI 37.1 mouse reference genome17,18. Cufflinks was used for quantitation and normalization. Cuffcompare/cuffdiff was used to identify differentially expressed genes and splicing events19,20.

29025411,cuffdiff,"Having ranked the nearby TE insertions as the predominant feature associated to Pol IV-mediated silencing of gene expression, we performed differential expression analysis to gain further insights into Pol IV targets. Unlike the expression profile comparisons previously applied, differential expression analysis are biased toward the identification of highly expressed genes; in other words, in standard transcriptome analysis, the probability that highly expressed genes would be detected as differentially expressed is greater than that for low-count genes, that mostly account for rpd1/rmr6 transcriptional rise (reviewed in [48]). Anyway, this differential expression analysis approach has the advantage of restricting the number of targets, specifically focusing on the predominant and statistically significant ones. Given the large number of samples analyzed (4 growth conditions, two timepoints for each genotype), we performed three independent pairwise comparisons grouping the sequenced samples in different combinations: i) Control-test-set (B73:C_T0 + B73:C_T7 vs rmr6:C_T0 + rmr6:C_T7); ii) Stress-test-set (B73:D_T0 + B73:S_T0 + B73:S + D_T0 vs rmr6:D_T0 + rmr6:S_T0 + rmr6:S + D_T0); iii) All-test-set (all B73 samples vs all rmr6 samples). In addition to the typical TopHat/Cuffdiff pipeline [49], this last set was also analyzed with RSEM software tools [50] that use an alternative strategy to effectively handle ambiguous/multiple-mapping reads, accurately estimating gene-level abundance starting from large numbers of short single-end reads. After RSEM quantification, differential expression was calculated with EBSeq [51]. RSEM + EBSeq identified a larger number of differentially expressed genes (log2FC > |2|, corresponding to 4-fold transcriptional variation, and FDR < 0.05) than the more conservative Cuffdiff (Table 1).

These reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm9) using Tophat software allowing no mismatch, then differentially expressed genes were analyzed by using Cuffdiff software. During this step, structural RNAs (e.g., ribosomal or mitochondrial RNA) were masked. To calculate relative fold change to control, only genes with expression cutoff above 5 reads per million per kilobase (RPKM) and OK test status were considered. Average RPKM from two biological replicates of each control (Ren) and TRIM33 shRNA expressed samples was then used to calculate fold change with log2 scale."

Approximately 2.7 − 3.9 × 105 paired-end reads (75-bp × 2) were obtained for each sample using the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina).

The sequence reads were processed using Trimmomatic version 0.38 (Am Mühlenberg, Altenau, Germany) [42] for adaptor trimming and quality filtering. The processed reads were mapped to the genome sequences of A. thaliana ecotype Col-0, CMV(Y), and CMV(H) using STAR version 2.7 (New York, NY, USA) [43] at default settings. Read counts per A. thaliana gene were retrieved using the quantification option in STAR, and were normalized and statistically tested using DESeq2 R package 3.7 (Boston, MA, USA) [44]. Adjusted p-values were calculated [45], and the threshold-adjusted p-value was set to 0.05 for the present study. Independent filtering in DESeq2 with an automatically optimized threshold was performed to filter out the genes with low mean normalized counts. Genes that passed independent filtering in both the necrotic cell death versus mock and HR cell death versus mock comparisons were further analyzed for differential expression. Genes with fold-change >4 or <0.25 at an adjusted p-value of <0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs with increased expression unique to HR cell death were classified as Class I; DEGs with commonly increased expression in HR cell death and necrotic cell death were classified as Class II; and DEGs with increased expression unique to necrotic cell death were classified as Class III. DEGs with decreased expression unique to HR cell death were classified as Class IV; DEGs with commonly decreased expression in HR cell death and necrotic cell death were classified as Class V; and DEGs with decreased expression unique to necrotic cell death were classified as Class VI. The VennDiagram package (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) [46] was used to generate Venn diagrams of the sets of DEGs that overlapped between HR cell death and necrotic cell death. Gene symbols and gene ontology (GO) information were extracted using Metascape (http://metascape.org/gp/index.html) (accessed on 11th, January, 2020) [47].

This set included exon locations for 54,752 genomic entities including pseudogenes, lncRNAs, and 21,949 protein coding genes. The resulting gene_id counts were normalized using edgeR (TMM) and tested for significant differential expression with Limma and Voom in R (v3.3.1) [45–47]. Prior to statistical testing, genes without more than 0.1 counts per million (CPM) in at least 3 samples were excluded (giving 24,227 genes). Three contrasts were made comparing each pairwise combination of LPS, IL-4, and PBS treatment groups for differential gene expression. A significance threshold of FDR = 0.05 was used with a secondary abs (log2FC) > 1 filter used to define the highest magnitude changes. After the PBS group was excluded from further analysis an additional minimum average expression filter of log2CPM > 0 in either the LPS or IL-4 groups was imposed. Expression values (log2CPM) for each sample are included as supplemental data. Some expression data was later converted to FPKM or z-scores for later visualization and comparison.

30065024,edger,"The 13-lined ground squirrel genome currently lacks high quality transcriptome and SNP annotations, complicating accurate assignment of variants as bona fide RNA-editing events using RNA-seq data. Commonly used methods for excluding polymorphisms from candidate RNA editing sites rely on SNP databases and therefore cannot be applied to remove SNPs from our candidate RNA-editing sites (Ramaswami et al. 2013). However, we reasoned that SNPs should be randomly distributed throughout our study population and would therefore not be enriched within samples derived from a specific hibernation state. We enumerated the number of reads with variant and reference alleles for each site and applied a statistical model to identify variants whose allele frequencies are significantly associated with a hibernation state. We applied a general linear model based ANOVA-like test (edgeR) to each set of the 12 possible mismatch types (i.e., A-to-G, A-to-C, T-to-G, etc.) and assessed changes in variant allele read counts while accounting for changes in the coverage at the site. From the original set of A-to-G variants (n = 179,295), we identified subsets of variants that are significantly associated with a hibernation state in the medulla (n = 990), hypothalamus (n = 3591), and cerebrum (n = 2962), respectively (FDR < 0.01). Moreover, these variants accounted for greater than 94% of the significant sites identified in each of these regions (Fig. 2B). The remaining minority population of variants (G-to-A, C-to-T, T-to-C, and A-to-T) were primarily transition mismatch variants that likely represent polymorphisms that passed our statistical cutoffs due to the large number of variants tested for significance. SNPs are distributed equally across both DNA strands, in contrast to RNA editing sites, which are specifically localized to the transcribed strand. The lack of enrichment for T-to-C variants in the set of hibernation state-dependent variants demonstrates that the significant A-to-G variant sites are not likely to be SNPs, but rather result from A-to-I RNA editing events mediated by the ADAR family of deaminases."

Transcript abundance was estimated in a genome-free manner using the alignment-based eXpress tool. eXpress aligns raw reads back against the de novo transcriptome and outputs expression-count estimates in Transcripts Per Million (TPM). DESeq2 uses these count estimates to analyze differential gene expression. Analysis was done in a pair-wise fashion, with each post-training time point being compared against the control. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were sorted by a strict ≥ 1 log2 fold-change and the P-values reported by DESeq2 were used to calculate False Discovery Rates (FDR) for all transcripts using the Benjamini-Hochberg transformation (0.1 ≥ FDR, Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

The RNA-Seq analysis was carried out for sequence reads obtained from the three genotypes. Throughout the analysis with CLC default settings were used. Briefly, after the trimming of the sequences they were mapped against the reference genome with the default settings. The expression values were calculated based on “reads per kilo base of exon model per million mapped reads” (RPKM) values (Mortazavi et al., 2008). The RNA-seq data was grouped accordingly and two group comparisons (unpaired) were performed. The expression values were normalized by scaling to the default setting of 10 million reads. Moderated t statistics for pairwise contrasts were calculated using the Baggerly’s test (Baggerly et al., 2003). Genes with no counts in all three replicates for at least one of the genotype/time combinations were discarded as not detectable above the background. Statistical analysis for the effect of genotype and time was conducted by a two-way ANOVA on the MeV software (Multi Experiment Viewer 4.9.0). The Baggerly’s p values were corrected for multiple testing for each contrast separately by means of false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) for significant genes based on ANOVA. FDR corrected p-value < 0.05 and log2 of fold change > 0.75 was used as a cutoff. All significantly induced or repressed genes with known functions were classified into groups based on gene ontology information obtained from the TAIR Database3 using MapMan (Thimm et al., 2004) and overrepresented functions and gene enrichment studies were carried out in Cytoscape using the BiNGO plugin (Maere et al., 2005)."

Principal components analysis and clustering of heat map plots showed that the three samples clustered by their biological replicates (fig. S4 and tables S1, A to C). As compared to the in vitro control, the expression of 560 and 617 genes was affected in the EMSH-reduced and EMSH-basal populations, respectively (FDR, ≤0.05; fold change, ≥1.5) (table S1, B and C). Of 295 genes showing overlap, 151 were more induced in the drug-tolerant EMSH-reduced population (Fig. 1B and table S1D). The transcriptome of both populations considerably overlapped with that of a previously reported transcriptional signature of intraphagosomal Mtb (P < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test; Fig. 1C) (17). Consistent with studies showing phagosomal acidification as the earliest cue that alters the transcriptome of Mtb inside unstimulated macrophages (18, 19), RNA-seq data of the EMSH-reduced fraction overlapped significantly with the transcriptome of Mtb grown in 7H9 broth at pH 5.5 (P = 1.05 × 10−2) and pH 4.5 (P = 1.5 × 10−15) (Fig. 1C) (17, 20).

The abundance of a transcript was measured in terms of “Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million fragments mapped” (FPKM), normalized for the transcript length and total number of cDNA fragments for a sample replicate. The difference in expression was obtained as the log of fold change in abundance between the two conditions. Statistical significance test for differential expression of each transcript was performed based on a negative binomial model estimated from the data [55]. The fold change of genes with multiple isoforms was assessed by summing up the FPKMs for all isoforms of a gene and then measuring the difference between the two conditions [55].

31242243,deseq2,"The transcriptome of NK cells after stimulation with tumor cells or cytokines was profiled by RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq). For this, resting NK cells (5×105) were washed twice and incubated alone or with either mitomycin-C-treated K562 or CTV-1 cells (1x106) for 6 hours or with IL-2 (200 IU/ml) for 16 hours at 37°C in 5% v/v CO2, after which NK cells were isolated from the co-culture using positive selection for CD56. RNA was extracted from the samples using the RNAqueous Micro Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at −80°C. To prepare the library, 100 ng of total RNA was processed using the KAPA mRNA HyperPrep Kit (p/n KK8580) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, mRNA was isolated from total RNA using Oligo dT beads to pull down poly-adenylated transcripts. The purified mRNA was fragmented using chemical hydrolysis (heat and divalent metal cation) and primed with random hexamers. Strand-specific, first strand cDNA was generated via a reverse transcriptase procedure in the presence of Actinomycin D. This allows for RNA-dependent synthesis while preventing spurious DNA-dependent synthesis. The second cDNA strand was synthesized using dUTP in place of dTTP to mark the second strand. The resultant cDNA was then “A-tailed” at the 3’ end to prevent self-ligation and adapter dimerization. Full-length xGen adaptors (IDT) containing two unique 8-bp sample-specific indexes, a unique molecular identifier (N8), and a T overhang were ligated to the A-Tailed cDNA. Successfully ligated cDNA molecules were then enriched with limited cycle PCR (14 cycles; the actual number is dependent on the amount of input RNA). The high-fidelity polymerase employed in the PCR is unable to extend through uracil. Thus, only first strand cDNA was amplified for sequencing, making the library strand-specific (first-strand). Prior to sequencing, libraries to be multiplexed in the same run were pooled in equimolar quantities, calculated from Qubit and Bioanalyser fragment analysis. Samples were sequenced on the NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina) using a 75 bp single read run with a corresponding 8 bp UMI read. For data analysis, run data were demultiplexed and converted to fastq files using Illumina’s bcl2fastq Conversion Software v2.19. Fastq files were then aligned to the human genome UCSC hg38 using RNA-STAR 2.5.2b then UMI deduplicated using Je-suite (1.2.1). Reads per transcript were counted using FeatureCounts and differential expression was estimated using the BioConductor package SARTools, which is a DESeq2 wrapper. All annotations and sequences were obtained from Illumina iGenomes (http://emea.support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html). Functional annotation analysis using gene ontology (GO) terms was performed on gene data sets that met the cutoff values (>1 Log2fold change, P-value <0.05) using the Panther Classification System gene list analysis tool (http://pantherdb.org)"

Each whole-hypocotyl tissue sample was collected from four hypocotyls pooled (seedlings were dissected just above the root–hypocotyl junction and just below the junction with the petioles). Each epidermal peel sample was collected from ∼60 seedlings. Outer layers at either the tops or bottoms of hypocotyl segments were gripped with fine forceps and pulled, removing a strip of cuticle and attached epidermal cells. One to two peels were made from each hypocotyl segment. During the peeling process, peels were left for up to 15 min at incubator temperature before snap-freezing in liquid N2. Samples were collected in triplicate, with collection times staggered randomly across a 24-h period. One of the shade-treated epidermal peel samples was removed from downstream analysis at the Cuffdiff step due to contamination with an unacceptable number of cells from the inner tissues (Supplemental Fig. S7E). For RNA-seq of Arabidopsis seedlings, plants were grown for 5 d in white light and then treated for 4 h with white light or shade. Seeds from a given silique were divided equally between conditions. Four replicates for each genotype and condition were collected. Ten to 15 whole seedlings were collected per replicate, and replicates were collected over two different days. We noted possible batch effects on gene expression related to silique of origin and day of sample collection (data not shown)."

The TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was used in the succeeding steps. Briefly, poly-A containing RNA molecules were purified from the total RNA samples (100 ng) using oligo-dT attached magnetic beads. Isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed into double-stranded cDNA, with actinomycin added during first-strand synthesis. The cDNA samples were fragmented, end repaired and polyadenylated before ligation of TruSeq adapters. Fragments containing TruSeq adapters on both ends were selectively enriched with PCR. The quality and quantity of the enriched libraries were validated using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and Bioanalyzer 2100. The product is a smear with an average fragment size of approximately 360 bp. The libraries were normalized to 10 nM in Tris-Cl 10 mM, pH 8.5 with 0.1% Tween-20. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 in single end 125 bp mode. The raw reads were first cleaned by removing adapter sequences, trimming low quality ends, and filtering reads with low quality (phred quality <20). Read-alignment was done with STAR (v2.5.1b).

As many of our students were interested in ecology, for this tutorial we used a data set describing the patterns of movement of local ocean wildlife, with personal instructor stories and images (including a shark-eating octopus!) to aid student engagement and friendly discourse with the instructors. From here, students worked in pairs through a series of tutorials to find differentially regulated genes (see the Supplemental Material). Students were allowed to work through each tutorial at their own pace, but were not given the next tutorial until all students were ready. This ensured that no particular group got too far ahead and that in-class questions and the resulting discussions were relevant to all students.

Two biological replicates each of ΔUPF1a and WT B2086 were used. After sequencing, filtered reads were mapped to the Tetrahymena macronuclear genome (obtained from http://ciliate.org/, release 2014) using the TopHat algorithm (Supplementary Table S4) and novel transcripts were identified using the Cufflinks toolkit (39). Differential gene expression and exon expression (or usage) analyses were carried out using the Cuffdiff and DEXSeq algorithms, respectively (40). The following criteria were used to identify transcripts upregulated in mutants: (i) the transcript FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped) should be 2-fold higher in mutants than in WT cells; (ii) the transcript should be significantly upregulated in a sample with biological replicates; or (iii) the transcript FPKM should be higher and exon expression significantly different in the mutant than in the WT strain (for ΔUPF1a only).

30429332,edger,"Selected transcription factors (TFs) and their predicted targets have been defined in expression networks (52). The Arabidopsis thaliana Regulatory Network (AtRegNet) describes the relationship of TFs and their direct target genes as to whether the targets are induced or repressed by a given TF (52). We compared the expression of TFs with that of their targets for each trisomy and ploidy change. TFs and their targets that are known were examined via ratio distributions in the trisomy data when the TF-encoding genes were on the varied chromosome (SI Appendix, Fig. S15). We also analyzed the distributions of TF expression and their targets that are not on the varied chromosome but that are modulated in expression in trans (SI Appendix, Fig. S15). These cases would represent those in which the trisomy changes the expression of an unlinked transcription factor, which in turn modulates its targets in a cascade of effects. From these distributions, we used only genes showing a significant differential expression generated by empirical analysis of digital gene expression data in R (edgeR) (53, 54) versus the diploid control (Materials and Methods) to compare with previously published interactions (SI Appendix, Table S6). Some trisomies show a considerable discordance between the positive or negative effects predicted from the network data and the aneuploidy response when identifying the expression of TFs in cis and their predicted targets. Across all five trisomies there is a range of discordance from 42 to 62% between the TF–target network relationship and the response in trisomy. Of course, the identified targets of transcription factors could be affected by other factors modulated by trisomy from the specific transcription factor examined, and the specified networks are likely to be variable under different conditions. In the whole-genome ploidy series there are few significant effects, because there is a lack of relative change in gene expression, as described above. The comparison of aneuploidy and ploidy illustrates the disruptive “dominant-negative” impact of altered genomic stoichiometry on gene expression when transcription factors or other regulatory molecules are varied in isolation from their interactors."

The arrays were then normalized using the RMA algorithm, and differential analysis was performed. Comparative analyses were conducted with the normalized signal intensity values between root tip Zone 1 and root tip Zone 2. The fold change was computed based on the normalized log‐transformed signal intensity data for each gene locus in the Zone 1 and Zone 2 groups. Differentially expressed transcripts were identified using a log2 fold change (log2 FC), at the 1% significance level, with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Genes differentially expressed with fold change of 2 or greater at FDR <0.01 were used for further analysis."

Using differential expression analysis (DEseq; p < 0.05, fold change >1.5), we observed a higher number of upregulated (n = 300) compared with downregulated genes (n = 129) in response to ARv7 depletion (Figure 2A), suggestive of a preferentially repressive ARv7 transcriptional function. In contrast, a slightly higher fraction of genes was downregulated (n = 293) rather than upregulated (n = 242) upon shARfl (Figure 2B). To identify the biological processes associated with these AR isoform-regulated genes, we next employed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005). In this analysis some ARfl-activated pathways over-lapped with ARv7-repressed ones, while others were unique, with an unclear discernible pattern (Table S1)."

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was removed from the total RNA using the Epicentre Ribo-Zero™ rRNA Removal Kit (Epicentre, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. High-throughput RNA-seq was performed on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The Illumina sequencing raw reads were cleaned by removing empty reads, adapter sequences, reads with over 10% N sequences, and low quality reads, in which the number of bases with a quality value Q ≤ 10 was >50%. In addition, rRNA reads were identified, by blasting against the rRNA database (http://www.arb-silva.de/) using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) software, and removed from the dataset. The filtered reads were mapped to the chicken reference genome (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-73/fasta/gallus_gallus/dna/) using the Tophat2 software. The mapped reads were assembled and transcripts were constructed using the Cufflinks 2.0.2 software. The Ensembl, NCBI RefGene, and UCSC databases were chosen as annotation references for lncRNA analyses. The Coding Potential Calculator (CPC), Coding-Non-Coding Index (CNCI) and Phylogenetic codon substitution frequency (PhyloCSF) were applied to estimate coding ability of potential lncRNAs. An RNA length ≥ 200 nt, CPC score ≤ 0, CNCI score ≤ 0, and PhyloCSF score ≤ −20 were used to evaluate the coding potential of transcripts. The RefSeq and Ensembl databases were used for gene analysis.

Approximately ~23 million reads aligned uniquely within the 41,595 M. musculus genes. We used TMM method [61] in the edgeR package [62] (v 3.20.5) to normalize the counts to log2-transformed counts per million (logCPM), using the cpm() function with prior.count = 3. Specifically, 25,141 genes did not have logCPM > log2(0.5) in at least three samples and were filtered out, leaving 16,454 genes to be analyzed for differential expression. TMM-values and logCPM normalized values were re-calculated with prior.count = 3 after gene filtering. Principle components analysis clustering of the samples (data not shown) indicated one of the treatment replicates was more variable than the other two. Rather than remove this sample completely, we did a surrogate variables analysis [63, 64] on the logCPM values, which estimated one surrogate variable that corrected for the difference in this replicate (data not shown). This surrogate variable was added to edgeR’s quasi-likelihood negative binomial generalized log-linear model [65], which was fit on the original read counts + TMM values to find differential expression between the treated and control groups.

28495677,deseq2,"The key feature of the RibOxi-seq method is the preparation of fragmented RNAs containing 3′-ends that are either unmethylated or 2′-O-methylated. Then, an oxidation step renders the nonmethylated ends incapable of ligation to linkers used for high-throughput library construction. After sequencing, the reads are aligned to a reference genome and only positions of the 3′-ends of aligned fragments are counted and displayed for each base position. The count data for oxidized and nonoxidized samples are then normalized, compared, and analyzed using DESeq2 for single-base resolution methylation site determination (Figs. 1, ​,2).2). The major difference between our method and currently available methods is its specificity and its reliance on positive rather than negative signals. In the RibOxi-seq method, the 2′ and 3′ hydroxyls of non-2′-O-methylated riboses are converted into dialdehydes using sodium periodate (NaIO4), thus preventing them from being ligated to linkers for sequencing library construction (Fig. 3A). Before this critical step, however, it is important to ensure that all possible 3′-ends are represented in the samples to be analyzed. While in theory this can be achieved simply by randomly digesting total RNA to generate small fragments, currently available methods do not readily expose 2′-O-methylated 3′-ends because 2′-O-methylated bases are resistant to nuclease or alkaline cleavage (Maden et al. 1995; Maden 2001). In the RibOxi-seq method, we use Benzonase nuclease for the first step of RNA degradation. The advantage of this step over alkaline hydrolysis is that Benzonase leaves 3′-ends that lack phosphates, thus eliminating an extra dephosphorylation step. However, like other nucleases, Benzonase is not able to cleave 5′–3′ phosphodiester bonds of 2′-O-methylated bases (Supplemental Fig. S1). As a consequence, the nearest possible position for a 2′-O-methylated base is one base upstream of the original 3′-end of an RNA fragment (Fig. 1). Thus, an additional step is required to remove at least one base from 3′-ends to expose methylated bases before final oxidation can be effective (Fig. 3B). Alefelder et al. (1998) used β-elimination to chemically remove oxidized RNA terminal oligonucleotides for the purpose of studying RNA oligonucleotide structure. We adapted their chemical reactions such that we first fragment RNAs to produce ends containing 2′,3′-OH groups. These are oxidized using NaIO4, and β-elimination is then carried out under alkaline conditions to remove the terminal oxidized RNA nucleotide, resulting in mixtures of RNA with either 2′-O-methylated or nonmethylated bases at their 3′-ends (Fig. 3B). After this step, terminal 2′-O-methylated bases possess 3′-phosphates, while nonmethylated bases have a mixture of cyclic-phosphates, 3′-phosphates, and 2′-phosphates. Like 2′-O-methylated bases, the 2′-phosphate and cyclic-phosphates on nonmethylated bases render these ends resistant to subsequent oxidation. Most available phosphatases, such as calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, are only active in removing 3′-phosphates. If used, nonmethylated bases with 2′-phosphates will survive the oxidation step and generate false-positive signals in sequencing. To prevent this phenomenon, T4 polynucleotide kinase (T4 PNK) is used. Although less efficient than other widely used phosphatases, the advantage is that this enzyme nevertheless is capable of removing all three types of phosphates under acidic conditions in the absence of ATP (Das and Shuman 2013). It has been shown that T4 PNK's phosphatase activity is sufficient to remove the majority of the phosphates in <40 min at 37°C (Honda et al. 2016). Since RNA fragments with phosphates can generate bias in subsequent steps, we have increased enzyme concentration and extended incubation time to 4 h. With proper end treatment, the mixtures generated after β-elimination and T4 PNK treatment contain fragments with ends of either 2′,3′-OH or 2′-OMe,3′-OH. The subsequent round of NaIO4 oxidation thus enriches 2′-O-methylated ends as only these fragments remain intact and are available for subsequent 3′-linker ligation and sequencing library construction."

Raw RNA-seq reads were subjected to analysis using Galaxy’s online platform to generate differential gene expression data between infection groups (41). Reads were clipped to remove any residual unique barcode sequences that were added during preparation of each sample for sequencing. Clipped reads were concatenated to combine multiple files per sample into a single file per sample. These files were groomed to ensure that all reads were in Sanger FASTQ format. FASTQ reads were aligned to the GRCm38 Ensembl build of the C57BL/6J mouse genome using the HISAT2 aligner, which locates the region of the genome to which each read corresponds, resulting in an output BAM file (42). All reads that did not align to the mouse genome (i.e., reads that originated from viral RNA) were discarded. The BAM files contained the alignment information for each read in that sample and were used as inputs into featureCounts, which quantifies the number of reads in each sample that corresponds to each gene in the mouse genome (43). Finally, the output count data from featureCounts was used as the input for DESeq2 to calculate differential expression for each gene across all samples and treatment groups. DESeq2 was used to generate normalized count values for each gene in all samples (44). These normalized counts are intended to correct for size differences between samples that might otherwise skew differential expression calculations if some samples contained substantially different numbers of total reads. The normalized count values were plotted and visualized in heat maps, generated using R, and line graphs, generated using Prism software."

32444465,edger,"To characterize the splicing landscape in different types of human peripheral CD3+ (CD4+/CD8+) T cells, in comparison to three T cell leukemia patients, we performed paired-end sequencing of the transcriptome to cover the splicing junctions. To study any T cell subtype-specific and differentiation stage-specific phenomena we also included a T cell subtype, CD4+ T cells, and undifferentiated fast-proliferating thymocytes. Initial expression analysis of normal and tumor samples using edgeR49 showed a significant up-regulation of oncogenic targets in T-ALL, including NOTCH1 targets, as well as cell cycle regulators, in agreement with previous findings in human and mouse contexts of T-ALL41 (Fig 1A and Supplementary Fig. 1A–D, Supplementary Tables 1–3). We then used rMATS50, an established method for quantitative analysis of differential splicing phenomena, to cluster splicing changes between peripheral CD3+ T cells and T-ALL, in five distinct categories: exon skipping, intron retention, mutually exclusive exons, and usage of alternative 3’ or alternative 5’ splice sites (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. 1E). We observed changes for each of these splicing categories between the two cell populations, with the most extensive splicing changes affecting skipped exons and retained introns (Fig. 1B, ​,CC and Supplementary Figs. 1E, 2A, B). Overall, there was a significant increase of exon skipping events in T-ALL cells compared to normal T cells (see red bar representing excluded exons, Fig. 1C). An alternative analysis quantifying exon inclusion levels and comparison of normal T cell subsets with T-ALL patients showed there are more exon inclusion phenomena in T cells compared to T-ALL (Supplementary Fig. 2C).

Due to the heterogeneity in the process of different workflows for RNA-Seq data analysis (37, 38), four different combinations of tools were chosen to get a less biased view of DE genes. As shown in the Venn diagram in Fig. 3a, when the same cutoff (q < 0.05) was applied to the results from all methods (with fold changes of at least ±0.5), the combination of Bowtie2 and DESeq2 (BtDe) generated the smallest number of DE genes (301 in total; 120 up- and 181 downregulated). Meanwhile, the combination of Salmon and DESeq2 (SmDe) produced the maximum number of DE genes (1,749 in total; 734 up- and 1,015 downregulated).

The significances (q-values) of these were then plotted against the magnitudes of age-dependent expression changes (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Source Data 1) (Pimentel et al., 2017). It is worth noting that we used an extensive catalog of full-length yeast transcripts (ORFs and non-coding RNAs, Figure 1—source data 3, [Lardenois et al., 2011; van Dijk et al., 2011; Davis and Ares, 2006; Xu et al., 2011; Yassour et al., 2010; Arribere and Gilbert, 2013; Nagalakshmi et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2011; Yassour et al., 2009]), including 5’ and 3’ UTR regions, for mapping sequencing reads. Strikingly, some of the most upregulated transcripts were those arising from the rDNA locus, specifically from the Sir2p-silenced non-transcribed regions (NTS1 and NTS2). Transcription at the non-transcribed sequence (NTS) locus is an aberrant Pol II event (almost undetectable in log phase culture) that has been previously shown to increase with age and ERC accumulation (Kobayashi and Ganley, 2005; Pal et al., 2018; Saka et al., 2013)."

Quality control was performed on all samples by examining the following parameters: (a) the percent of reads uniquely mapping to the genome; (b) the percent of reads mapping to known protein coding sequence; (c) the number of exon junctions identified; (d) the percent of spliced reads; and (e) the number of genes with 90% base coverage (Additional file 1: Table S1). TopHat-Fusion version 0.1.0 [23] was used to identify gene fusions. HTSeq version 0.5.3 (http://www.huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq) was used to identify differentially-expressed genes by counting the number of reads mapping to each gene from Ensembl version 68. The TMM method was used to normalise read counts and differential expression tested for using a paired generalized linear model design with the Bioconductor version 2.11 edgeR package [24]. The Circos plot was generated using RCircos version 1.1.2 [25]. Correlations were identified using Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient (p < 0.05).

For cell treatments, culture media was replaced with fresh, warm media containing vehicle (H2O) for 8 hours, or 200nM OxA for 3 or 8 hours. RNA was isolated with TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s protocol, including the addition of 10μg RNase-free glycogen (ThermoFisher). The RNA samples were then treated with DNase (New England Biolabs) to remove any genomic DNA contamination and then cleaned up with the Purelink RNA Micro Kit (Invitrogen). This process was repeated twice for n = 3 per condition. The DNase-treated Total RNA (250ng) was depleted of ribosomal RNA using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit (Illumina) and quality assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer to confirm that 18S and 28S rRNA peaks were depleted. The rRNA-depleted RNA was converted to dsDNA libraries by following the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA sample prep kit user guide. Briefly, the RNA was fragmented, converted to cDNA, and ligated with adaptors. The adaptor-ligated DNA was then PCR amplified using 11 cycles to generate the final libraries. The final libraries were size selected and purified using 1.0 x Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) then validated by the Bioanalyzer and qPCR quantified using primers that recognize the Illumina adaptors. The libraries were then pooled at equimolar ratios, quantified using qPCR (quantification of only the adaptor-ligated libraries) and loaded onto the NextSeq 500 flow cell (Illumina) at 1.8pM final concentration. Demultiplexed and quality filtered raw reads (fastq) generated from the NextSeq 500 were trimmed (adaptor sequences) using Trimmomatic, version 0.35 [56] and aligned to the reference genome (UCSC-mm10) using STAR, version 2.5.2a [57]. HTSeq-count (version 0.6.0) was used to generate gene counts and differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (version 1.10.1, R version: 3.2.3) [58], comparing the OxA-treated samples to those treated with vehicle. The principle component analysis was performed via the plotPCA function in DESeq2, using the regularized log-transformed values of the 500 genes that were the most variable across all samples. In order to more closely identify the relationship between each sample and every other sample, the Euclidean distance between each pair of samples was calculated using the log-transformed values of the complete data set. Complete linkage clustering was then used to generate a sample-to-sample distance heatmap, via the pheatmap package in R source. For statistical analyses, raw counts for the two conditions of interest were imported into DESeq2 and transformed using the negative binomial Wald test. Adjusted p-values were generated via the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure."
30841905,cufflinks,"Raw data (raw reads) of fastq format were first processed through in-house perl scripts. In this step, clean data (clean reads) were obtained by removing adapter sequences as well as reads containing poly-N and low quality reads. Therefore, only high quality data were analyzed and quality scores (Q20 and Q30) and GC content were subsequently calculated. All the following analyses were based on the clean data with high quality. Reads were mapped to the chicken genome assembly [14] using Tophat (v2.0.9). The mapped reads of each sample were assembled by both Scripture (beta2) and Cufflinks (v2.1.1) in a reference-based approach."
31067455,sleuth,"Because we observed high rates of likely PCR duplicates among the reads for most samples, the raw reads were de-duplicated using ParDRe (Gonzalez-Dominguez and Schmidt, 2016), allowing one mismatch and using an 18 bp prefix. Testing on internal controls using the ERCC spike-in mix showed that de-duplication improved the correlation of transcript abundances with known relative values (data not shown). Surviving reads that had any recognizable fragment of the Nugen sequencing adaptor were removed using cutadapt 1.8.1 (Martin, 2011) and low quality ends were removed using Trimmomatic 0.22 (Bolger et al., 2014) to remove all terminal bases with quality scores below three, and then requiring that for surviving bases, their average quality score over a 4 bp window was at least 15. Reads with fewer than 20 surviving bases were subsequently dropped. Preprocessed reads were aligned to the Drosophila melanogaster Flybase release 6.08 transcriptome, augmented with Gal4 and EGFP transcript sequences, using kallisto0.43.0 (Bray et al., 2016) with a k-mer size of 21 and 200 bootstrap replicates. We used sleuth (Pimentel et al., 2017) for further postprocessing of the RNA-seq data; in particular, all significance tests for differential expression on RNA-seq data use p values or q-values (as noted) from sleuth for a Wald test on the coefficient distinguishing the groups in question. While we initially obtained three biological replicates for each of the CD and SD cases, we noted that one replicate from each condition was a substantial outlier from all other points (across both conditions) based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence between samples; we excluded that outlier pair from all described analysis. Similar pruning was applied to other sample sets. The final numbers of biological replicates for analyzed sequencing data are given in Table S1. For the pathway analysis in Figure S7, we used iPAGE (Goodarzi et al., 2009) to find gene ontology (GO) terms showing significant mutual information with the profile of fitted gene-level effect sizes from sleuth. Note that due to the several tests incorporated into the iPAGE pipeline (many of which are not shown), the overall false discovery rate of the procedure on expression profiles has been empirically been shown to be less than 0.05 (Goodarzi et al., 2009). To classify genes for the Venn diagram in Figure 7D, we first selected only the set of genes showing significant changes in expression between CD and SD (q < 0.1), and then conditioning on membership in that set, calculated FDR-corrected p values for the significance of changes in transcript level for the same genes between the Gr5a-GAL4/UAS-OGT RNAi flies and the corresponding Gr5a-GAL4/+ controls, (using a threshold of an FDR-corrected p value < 0.2). Genes showing significant expression changes in both experiments were classified based on the signs of the observed log fold changes. For the pathway analysis shown in Figure 7E, we used iPAGE (Goodarzi et al., 2009) to identify GO terms showing significant mutual information with the status of genes as being in any of the oppositely-regulated categories of Figure 7D, or among the set of all other genes (a ‘background’ set that is not shown). iPAGE calculations used GO term annotations from the dmel_r6.08 Flybase release.

To resolve the DNA binding sites of Firre genome-wide, we performed RNA Antisense Purification (RAP)19. RAP along with CHiRP31, CHART32, ChOP33 provide genome-wide DNA-binding locations for RNAs by cross-linking chromatin and RNA, followed by the targeting and pull-down of a specific RNA using antisense oligos19. We performed RAP in male mESCs using two sets of 120 bp antisense probes targeting Firre and two sets of sense probes as negative controls (Supplementary Table 3), followed by sequencing to identify genomic regions directly bound by Firre. We observed a ~5 Mb domain of Firre localization around the Firre locus (Fig. 3A).

Besides expression in the ventral cord cholinergic motoneurons (VA, VB, DA, and DB), GFP expressed from juIs14 is also present in several unidentified neurons in the head and tail [10]. RNA-seq data from isolated wild-type neurons was analyzed with the Cufflinks program to identify expressed genes (Materials and methods, S2 Table). The gene list for the neurons labeled by Pacr-2::gfp from wild type animals was compared with a recent study that profiled major tissue-types in adult C. elegans [22]. We found that almost all of the genes identified in our dataset (~95%) were also detected in a pan-neuronal analyses of expressed genes (Fig 1A), but shared very little overlap with tissue-specific expression profiles identifying enriched transcripts in hypodermis and muscle (Fig 1A). This comparison suggests our samples were relatively free of contamination from surrounding non-neuronal tissue. We also compared our gene list to previous analysis of a subset of cholinergic motoneurons (VA and DA) labeled with Punc-4::gfp [23]. Although the cell-types analyzed in these studies are not identical (A-type only vs. neurons expressing Pacr-2::gfp), and they were performed at different life stages (larval vs. young adult in this study) using different techniques (microarray vs. RNA-seq in this study), over half of the genes (~75%) from our dataset were also identified by microarray in larval type A motoneurons (Fig 1B). These include core cholinergic genes such as unc-17/VAChT (Avg. FPKM = 484.1) and pan-neuronal genes such as unc-13 (Avg. FPKM = 90.9), required for synaptic vesicle priming [24,25]. Additionally, both of these datasets were relatively free of transcripts enriched in GABAergic motoneurons.

33259630,deseq2,"Liver RNA was extracted from 30 to 50 mg of tissue using the RNEasy miniprep kit, according to manufacturer protocols (Qiagen, Valencia, California). The RNA integrity number for all samples was ≥7 (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer). Library creation and sequencing were performed using a single-end 125 bp protocol on the Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer, with approximately 33 million uniquely mapped reads generated per sample. Quality control of read data was evaluated using FastQC and STAR short read aligner was used to align reads to Mus musculus (mm10) reference genome. Mapped read number was determined using featureCounts software, with data normalized for distortion and depth. The DESeq2 Bioconductor package in R normalized count data by fitting a generalized linear model for each gene, taking into account sex on PND42 and exposure group on PND1, PND21, and PND42 (CdCl2, control). No samples were excluded from differential expression based on QC analysis. Differential expression analysis of 14 259 genes (PND1 and PND21) and 13 092 genes (PND42) between sex and exposure was set to adjusted p = .05 cutoff to identify differences between control and CdCl2 exposure. A sample heat map of overall mapped reads, volcano plot, and hierarchical cluster diagrams are included for each time point (Supplementary Figs. 1 − 3). Identification of counts in a minimum of 75% of samples was required for further analysis of differential expression between control and CdCl2 exposure groups or between female and male mice. For all samples, the overall mean of the normalized counts, the log2 (fold-change), and the adjusted p value (padj, adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate, FDR) were determined and analyzed for gene pathway enrichment using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software platform (Spring 2020 version, Qiagen). For PND21 and PND42, FDR was set to 5%, and for PND1 an FDR of 15% was used because of known increased gene expression variability at birth (Doktor et al., 2017). Along with IPA, GOTERMFINDER (Boyle et al., 2004) and WebGestalt (Liao et al., 2019) were used to identify ontology, KEGG pathways, and molecular pathways associated with differentially expressed gene (DEG) responses to CdCl2 exposure.

DNase I was used to degrade any possible DNA contamination. 1 µg of total RNA was used to prepare standard RNA-seq libraries (TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit, Illumina) based on polyA+ isolation. RNA concentration ranged from 326 to 394 ng/µl, and samples showed optimal integrity with RIN values of 9.80. The libraries had an average length of 337–367 nt and were quantified by quantitative PCR (Kapa Biosystems) using a previously quantified library as standard. Samples were loaded onto a lane of a flowcell using the Cluster Station apparatus (Illumina) and sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx platform (Parque Científico de Madrid, Spain) under a single read (1 × 75) protocol. There were approximately 25 million and 17 million reads (75-nt length) for MEL and MEL-R libraries, respectively, which were used for further bioinformatics analysis. The median quality score was >30 across all sites of the reads (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html). The sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome (Mus_musculus_NCBI_build37.67.cdna, 30-04-2012) with TopHat v2.0.1.

The workflow outlining the analysis of RNA sequencing data is shown in Fig S1. Samples (unreplicated MEL and MEL-R) were further analyzed using the DESeq package for R Statistical Analysis (Anders & Huber, 2010). We used DESeq as a complementary differential gene expression analysis to compare the results with those obtained by Cuffdiff (Fig. S2).

RNA was ribo-depleted, and RNA sequencing was performed using an Illumina NextSeq 500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with an average of 20 million reads per sample at The Scripps Research Institute NGS Core facility. The single-end reads that passed Illumina filters were filtered for reads aligning to transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, adapter sequences and spike-in controls. The reads were then aligned to UCSC hg19 reference genome using TopHat (v 1.4.1, Baltimore, MD, USA). DUST scores were calculated with PRINSEQ Lite (v 0.20.3, open source software), and low-complexity reads (DUST>4) were removed from the BAM files. The alignment results were parsed via the SAMtools to generate SAM files. Read counts to each genomic feature were obtained with the htseq-count program (v 0.6.0) using the ‘union' option. After removing absent features (zero counts in all samples), the raw counts were imported into R/Bioconductor package DESeq2 to identify differentially expressed genes among the samples. DESeq2 normalizes counts by dividing each column of the count table (samples) by the size factor of this column. The size factor is calculated by dividing the samples by the geometric means of the genes. This brings the count values to a common scale suitable for comparison. P-values for differential expression were calculated using binomial test for differences between the base means of two conditions. The P-values were adjusted for multiple test correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg algorithm to control the false discovery rate. Cluster analyses, including principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering, were performed using standard algorithms and metrics.

32538777,cufflinks,"We next wondered whether splicing was affected by the rnp-6 G281D mutation. We analyzed splicing patterns of the transcriptomic data using Cufflinks (Trapnell et al., 2012) and KISSDE (Lopez-Maestre et al., 2016) protocols. 83 genes (Figure 3A, Figure 3—source data 1) were found to be alternatively spliced upon S. aureus infection in wildtype animals. When comparing infected wildtype animals and infected rnp-6(dh1127) mutants, we found a larger number of alternatively spliced genes (456 genes) (Figure 3A, Figure 3—source data 2). The number of alternatively spliced genes induced by S. aureus could be underestimated as a result of the short infection time used (4 hr post-infection) and tissue-specific alternative splicing masked in the transcriptome from whole animals. Over half of the genes (43 out of 83) (Figure 3A, Figure 3—source data 3) showing infection induced alternative splicing, were also altered in the infected rnp-6(dh1127) mutants when compared to infected wildtype N2 animals. This suggests that the splicing alteration induced by infection is partly dependent on rnp-6. We also analyzed the data with the SAJR algorithm, which gives a detailed classification of the splicing events (Mazin et al., 2013). In wildtype animals, S. aureus infection induced splicing events were predominated by ‘cassette exon’ (44.9%) and ‘retained intron’ (22.4%). This was also true when we compared infected rnp-6(1127) mutants with infected wildtype animals (‘cassette exon’ 59.5%, ‘retained intron’ 15.2%) (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B). Using RT-PCR and agarose electrophoresis, we analyzed the splicing patterns of prg-2, gyg-1 and tos-1. whose splicing is both infection and rnp-6 dependent. S. aureus infection enhanced intron one splicing in prg-2 in wildtype animals, but this effect was substantially suppressed in the rnp-6(dh1127) mutants (Figure 3B). Infection also led to inclusion of exon 6 and exon 7 of gyg-1, and again this effect was largely suppressed by the G281D substitution in the dh1127 mutants (Figure 3C). Further, infection increased the abundance of the short tos-1 isoform in wildtype animals (Figure 3D). Intriguingly, the rnp-6 G281D mutants had an increased longer to shorter isoform ratio under non-infected condition, and this ratio remained the same after infection (Figure 3D), suggesting it is refractory to input. Taken together, these data show that bacterial infection induces an RNP-6 dependent splicing remodeling in C. elegans."

33046735,limma,"Sequencing data (fastq files) were uploaded to and analyzed on the Galaxy web platform (usegalaxy.eu)72, as previously described73. Quality control was performed with FastQC Galaxy Version 0.72 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ last access on 11/19/2019). Reads were mapped to the human reference genome (Gencode, release 32, hg38) with RNA STAR Galaxy Version 2.7.2b74 with default parameters using the Gencode annotation file (Gencode, release 32, https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/releases.html). Reads mapped to the human reference genome were counted using featureCounts Galaxy Version 1.6.475 with default parameters using the aforementioned annotation file. The output of featureCounts was imported to RStudio (Version 1.2.1335, R Version 3.5.3). Gene symbols and gene types were determined based on ENSEMBL release 98 (Human genes, GRCh38.p12, download on 11/19/2019)76. Genes without EntrezID and with zero mean reads were removed from analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA)77 was applied to check for potential batch effects, which were removed by the limma function removeBatchEffect78 and by consideration within the linear model of DESeq277. Differential gene expression was analyzed using the R package DESeq2 Version 1.22.277 with default parameters (Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p values). Transcripts with log2 fold change (log2 FC) > 2 or < -2 and adjusted p value < 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEG). Heatmaps were created with the R package ComplexHeatmap 1.20.079. Other data visualization was performed using the ggplot2 package80. Gene enrichment analysis and its visualization were done using the R package clusterProfiler 3.10.181. Cell type enrichment analysis was performed using xCell19. The tool uses sequencing-derived transcriptomic signatures of 64 distinct immune and stroma cell types to estimate the relative contributions of these cells to a bulk RNA transcriptome. Transcripts per million were calculated as an input for the analysis based on the output of featureCounts (assigned reads and feature length), as previously described82. xCell enrichment scores were compared between different groups using the Mann–Whitney U test. The log2 fold change of enrichment scores between different groups was defined as the log2 of the quotient of mean enrichment scores of each group. To define a prognostic transcriptome signature of CM, a three-step method, as described by van´t Veer et al.66, was applied. In a first step, DEG between CM with poor and good outcome were determined, as described above. Subsequently, the Pearson correlation between each gene and outcome was calculated. All genes were then arranged by the absolute value of their correlation coefficient. The top five genes were selected and their expression profile in one sample was correlated to each gene’s mean expression of the remaining samples of the poor and good prognosis group, respectively. These steps were repeated until each sample was left out once (leave-one-out validation), as described previously66,67. Classification accuracy was determined by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating curves (ROC). To find the optimal number of prognostic genes, the next top five genes were added to the signature and its classification accuracy was evaluated, as described above. This process was repeated until the AUC stopped improving."

27787515,cufflinks,"We performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis through RNA-sequencing of CV/Fol taste cells isolated from C57Bl/6 mice belonging to different age groups (2 and 6 months). Isolated taste cells were collected from multiple mice and pooled together. Each replicate had taste cells isolated from 3–4 mice. Three such pooled experimental replicates were used for the RNA analysis. This provided sufficient RNA that no amplification of the mRNA was needed which reduces any potential bias that occurs due to an RNA amplification step. Figure 1a depicts the workflow of RNA-sequencing analysis performed to study the differential gene expression pattern of 2 and 6 month CV/Fol taste cells. Before sequencing, the quality of RNA was evaluated using a Bioanalyzer profile to ensure degradation had not occurred. The raw RNA-sequencing data were analyzed using the Tuxedo protocol (TopHat, Cufflinks and Cuffdiff) followed by visualization using CummeRbund. The RNA-seq read counts (FPKM) at the gene and the replicate genes level between 2 and 6-month-old mice CV/Fol taste cells were plotted as box-plots and show the normalized expression values (Figures 1b and c). These data demonstrates that the samples were comparable in their overall variability which increases our confidence that the differences detected were not due to skewed data. A density plot evaluates the quality of normalized distributions of FPKM scores across the analyzed samples which also show no difference in the distributions of the data sets (Figure 1d). The quality of RNA-sequencing data was further evaluated to assess the cross-replicate variability by measuring the variance of genes in 2 and 6-month-old mice taste samples (Figure 1e) and to rule out any bias due to over-dispersion for the two data sets (Figure 1f). As the data sets are comparable, we know that the differences that have been detected are not due to inherent biases in the data set but are due to changes in the expression patterns between the two samples. The scatter plot (Figure 1g) and the volcano plot (Figure 1h) identifies the global changes and trends in gene expression between 2 and 6-month-old mice taste samples.

We implemented de novo transcriptome assembly using Cufflinks (25) and identified previously unannotated lincRNAs as well as those previously annotated in GENCODE and the Human BodyMap (11). We then excluded monoexonic transcripts and transcripts shorter than 200 nt in length as these may represent transcriptional artifacts (26). We identified 244 previously unannotated lincRNA loci after removing transcripts with coding potential or which overlapped with any known protein-coding genes, already annotated lincRNAs, small RNAs, or pseudogenes. To identify lincRNAs reliably expressed in adipose tissue, we excluded lincRNAs with expression lower than the first percentile of all adipose tissue coding and noncoding transcripts. We identified 1001 lincRNAs (144 not previously annotated) in subcutaneous adipose tissue of all 25 subjects. In the context of this paper, we term these 1001 lincRNAs reliably expressed in human adipose tissue as “adipose lincRNAs,” recognizing that many of these adipose-expressed lincRNAs may also be expressed in other tissues."

RNA-Seq libraries were constructed using SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit - Pico Input Mammalian (Takara Bio USA, Inc. Mountain View, USA). In brief, 2 ng of total RNA from each sample was fragmented and reverse-transcribed to cDNA, and then adapters for Illumina sequencing (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) (with specific barcodes) were added through PCR. The PCR products were purified, and then ribosomal cDNA was depleted using probes specific to mammalian rRNA. The cDNA fragments were further amplified with primers universal to all libraries. These libraries were pooled together and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 to generate approximately 40 million 2 × 100 paired-end reads for each sample. The raw data was demultiplexed and analyzed further. Sequence alignment was performed using RNA-STAR [33], quantitation was performed with subread featureCounts [34], and comparisons of expression was performed with DESeq2 [35].

Duplicate reads were removed using the picard command MarkDuplicates.jar (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard). Gene expression levels were quantified as read counts using the featureCounts function from the Subread package with default parameters102. The read counts were used to identify differential gene expression between conditions and generate RPKM values using the edgeR package103. Genes were considered differentially expressed if they had an adjusted p-value (FDR) of less than 0.05. Strand-specific RNA-seq was visualized on UCSC using the bam file as input for Homer98 commands makeTagDirectory (with options -flip and -sspe) and makeMultiWigHub.pl (with option -strand separate).

Messenger (polyA+) RNAs were purified from 1 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT). Libraries were prepared using the strand-specific RNA-Seq library preparation TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit (Illumina). Libraries were multiplexed by 4 on 1 flowcell lane. A 50-bp single-read end sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 1500 device (Illumina). A minimum of 37 million passing Illumina quality filter reads were obtained for each of the 4 samples. TruSeq adapters were removed with trimmomatic v0.36 [94] using the parameters “ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-SE.fa:2:30:10 LEADING:5 TRAILING:5 MINLEN:20.” Reads were mapped on TAIR10 genome assembly of A. thaliana genome providing the gene annotation obtained from Araport11 [95] using STAR [96].

The cDNA libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to produce paired-end 100 bp reads. One library of reads per biological sample was examined for sequencing errors prior to mapping. Sequencing alignment was performed by STAR ver 2.6.0c, and the sequence data were analyzed with the edgeR-based R, version 3.5.0 (R Core Development Team, Vienna, Austria) pipeline. Differences between the control and FGF19-treatment samples with a p < 0.01 were considered significant. Gene ontology (G/O) was analyzed by the DAVID 6.8.

To investigate the source of IL-22 that directs epithelial SAA production following SFB colonization, we compared RNA expression profiles from small intestine Th17 cells and ILC3 in mice stably colonized with SFB. Based on normalized DESeq reads, IL-22 expression was ten-fold higher in ILC3s than in Th17 cells (Figure S5A). Examination of these data sets also revealed a surface antigen, killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily B member 1B (Klrb1b), which was uniquely expressed in ILC3. We confirmed this finding at the level of protein by flow cytometry (Figure S5B), and subsequently incorporated Klrb1b into the fluorescent cell-labeling panel to dispense with the necessity of a reporter in studying the dynamic behavior of ILC3 upon SFBe colonization."

The strands were also required minimum quality of 20 in both ends. TopHat (v.2.1.0) was used for mapping reads to the D. melanogaster reference genome (Flybase R6.10). The HTSeq was used for strand-specific quantification of exons with reads below quality of 10 discarded. The differential expression analysis was performed with R/Bioconductor package limma. Low expressed genes were filtered, expressed genes requiring to have cpm>1 in at least 3/4 replicates in at least one of the conditions. For the gene set enrichment analysis we used R/Bioconductor package piano (v.1.1.16.2). Command runGSA was used with GSEA algorithm and row sampling with 1000 permutations for all expressed genes.

Next, the aligned reads were assigned to gene features using featureCounts [24]. Reads that mapped to rRNA (60–80%) were removed in silico (final number of reads in Table S3). Subsequently, counts were first normalized by gene length and then by the number of non-ribosomal reads in each sample to obtain RPKM values. Sample variance was analysed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in R and outliers were excluded from the transcriptional analysis. Therefore, samples from assay MCCM_3 were discarded while samples from two independent assays in MCCM and samples from three independent assays for LB medium were considered for further analysis. Heat map of P. aeruginosa PAO1 genes was also built (Figure S3). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using a negative binomial distribution test from DESeq Bioconductor package in R [25].

The nondetected MaxQuant intensities were imputed with the minimum nonzero intensity value of the corresponding technical replicate. Proteins MaxQuant identified only by site or labeled as potential contaminants were filtered out of the analysis. We preprocessed the data by summarizing technical replicates with medians, transformed the values to a logarithmic scale, and did the quantile normalization. We used Bioconductor package limma [71] to perform moderated t test with paired design to detect the differentially abundant proteins between iTreg and Th0 cells and Th17 and Th0 cells. Moderated t test with unpaired design was used to detect the differentially abundant proteins between iTreg and Thp cells as well as iTreg and Th17 cells. Statistical tests were done for such proteins that had at least 1 detected protein intensity value in both conditions. We performed the tests separately for the proteins detected in all samples and for the proteins that were not detected in some of the samples. For the latter proteins, we ignored samples whose corresponding sample pairs were not detected. By using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple correction, the differentially abundant proteins were identified with FDR < 0.05. Those proteins that had detected intensities in only 1 of the conditions were identified without statistical testing and were called as “selectively expressed.” All proteins that had at least 2 paired biological replicates are considered detected."

Though the expected paucity of reads mapping upstream of TSSs likely increases the threshold for significance across all TSSs, we reasoned that taking an approach that assigns significance partially based on the number of reads assigned to the feature in question would help in identify lowly elongating coding nuTSS transcripts oriented in the sense direction relative to their resident genes, since more reads would accumulate in both upstream and downstream regions in those cases."

32620892,deseq2,"The endogenously tagged PYYM_0017400.GFP cell line now provides an ideal opportunity to study co-regulation of yir expression in P. yoelii. For this, triplicates of RNA extracted from trophozoite-stage wild-type PYYM as well as 2 clones of PYYM_0017400.GFP were analysed by RNA sequencing. To avoid missing any yir genes in our downstream analysis, the RNA seq raw data was mapped to the reference genome of P. yoelii 17X due to the larger number of yir gene annotation in PlasmoDB (the ID of PYYM_0017400 in the P. yoelii 17X annotation is PY17X_1100077). This approach provided with a high confidence transcription data set for the yir in P. yoelii (Fig. 6). We observed that approximately 50% of the yir genes are transcribed within the population, with the majority of the yir genes having low expression levels, similar to what was reported by Cunningham et al.56. In order to remove yirs with low or no expression levels, we omitted yirs with estimated counts of less than 20 from our final analysis. The estimated read counts are the counts obtained after the deconvolution process by the program algorithm. It is the estimated number of reads found mapped to the transcript. Using a cut-off value of 20 estimated counts, a total of 60 yir genes were found to be commonly expressed in the samples. Comparison of the yir expression in parental YM parasites to the two PYYM_0017400.GFP activated clones using Deseq2, identified three distinct groups; four yir genes were upregulated, 36 yir genes were downregulated and 20 yir genes showed no change in expression (Fig. 6a).

29958539,edger,"RNA-seq reads were aligned with the GEMtools RNA-seq pipeline v1.7 (http://gemtools.github.io), which is based on the GEM mapper [73]. The pipeline aligns the reads in a sample in three phases, mapping against the reference genome (dicLab v1.0c, Jul. 2012), against a reference transcriptome (COMBINED ANNOTATION track) and against a de novo transcriptome, generated from the input data to detect new junction sites. The sea bass genome used here is one of the best in silico annotated fish genomes [31]. After mapping, all alignments were filtered to increase the number of uniquely mapped reads. The filtering criteria included a minimum intron length of 20 bp, a maximum exon overlap of 5 bp and a filter step against a reference annotation checking for consistent pairs and junctions where both sites align to the same annotated gene. The libraries’ statistics including the number of raw reads and the average reads aligned can be found in Additional file 2. The same pipeline was used to quantify expression at the gene level. Similarity across RNA-seq samples was investigated with principal component analysis (PCA; Additional file 1: Fig. S8A), where the first principal component separated the samples by tissue type and explained almost 96% of the variance. One muscle sample was excluded from further analysis since it was clearly an outlier in the quality clustering. The variation in gene expression values was higher and with more extreme values in muscle (Levene’s test; p < 0.001), whereas the testis had higher expression median (Mood’s median test; χ2 = 3372.7, p < 0.001; Additional file 1: Fig. S9A). Subsequently, the TMM method [74] was used for gene expression normalization, which takes into account not only library size (sequencing depth) of the samples but also the composition of the RNA population. The EdgeR robust method [75] was used for differential expression analysis. Genes with p adjusted < 0.05 were considered significant. Positive log2-transformed fold change (FC) indicates up-regulation in testis, and negative log2FC indicates down-regulation in testis. There were 9449 up-regulated genes and 6220 down-regulated genes in testis compared to muscle (FDR < 0.05). Furthermore, most of the genes expressed in both tissues had higher expression levels in the testis than in the muscle (Additional file 1: Fig. S9B). Tissue-specific genes were considered the genes that were expressed in only one of the two tissues, regardless of the actual expression level. Approximately 20 and 2000 genes accounted for half of the number of reads mapped in the muscle and testis, respectively (Additional file 1: Fig. S9C). However, the testis-specific genes had lower median expression (Mood’s median test; χ2 = 32.282, p < 0.001) than the muscle-specific genes (Additional file 1: Fig. S9D). These results confirmed that the testis and muscle constitute two tissues with very different transcriptomic complexity and validated our choice of tissues for the purposes of this study."
29999500,edger,"We built transcript profiles of individual cells by using Cell Ranger v1.1.0 software with default settings for demultiplexing, aligning reads with STAR software to mouse genome GRCm38 and Hg19 for humans, and counting unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). We used the Seurat v2.0 R package along with a gene-barcode matrix provided by CellRanger for downstream analysis (63). In total, we filtered the data in 2 different steps. We first filtered the data set by only accepting cells that contained about 200 genes/cell and genes that were expressed at a minimum of 3 cells. The UMI were log normalized genes with high expression, and variable genes were identified by the mean variance relationship method. Our second filter was done by using linear regression. We removed cells that had above 4,500 UMIs and a 2 × 10–5 percent.mito in the mouse data and 5,000 UMIs with a percent.mito of 0.1 in the human data. Using the RegressOut function, we took out cells that contained high mitochondrial genes. Next we used principle component analysis (PCA) to identify components that could be found within our data set for unsupervised clustering. JackStrawPlot function in Seurat was used to find significant principle components (PC) for each data set. We selected 10 different PCAs for unsupervised clustering of both data sets. Clustering results were visualize using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) algorithm in the Seurat package. For mouse data, 7 clusters were identified, but 2 clusters were not analyzed because they contained fewer than 10 cells and 1 cluster was suppressed because it contained more than 10% mitochondrial genes in the top 50 genes at an adjusted P value, leaving 4 main clusters. In the human data set, we found 4 clusters that encompassed the mesenchyme, which was divided into proximal, intermediate, and distal clusters. Differentially expressed genes between clusters were identified using the Cell Ranger method, which applies the Shrinkage estimation of dispersion (sSeq), employing a negative binomial exact test. The algorithm runs for each cluster against the rest of the clusters through a fast asymptotic β test used in edgeR. Cell Ranger computes relative library size as the total UMI counts for each cell divided by the mean UMI counts per cell as a way to normalize by the per cell library size, which is a parameter incorporated in calculations of differentially expressed genes. Dot plots were created using the Seurat DotPlot function to visualize the percentage of cells expressing a gene and the average expression level between our clusters. For cluster visualization and individual gene visualization on all clusters, we used the tSNE function. GO enrichment analysis was performed using the PANTHER overrepresentation test and entering the top 250 overexpressed genes in each cluster. Odds ratios and P values of overlap between mouse and human mesenchymal subsets were calculated using Fisher’s exact test for enrichment using a base value of 21,000 genes in the mouse and human genome, respectively."

The RNeasy RNA purification kit (Qiagen) was then used as per the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, US). The level of ribosomal RNA present in total RNA samples was reduced prior to library construction using the Ribo-Zero Gram-Positive Bacteria rRNA Removal Kit (Epicentre). Illumina RNAseq libraries were prepared with the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, California, US), omitting the poly-A selection steps. Adapters containing six nucleotide indices were ligated to the double-stranded cDNA. The DNA was purified between enzymatic reactions, and the size selection of the library was performed with AMPure XT beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, Massachusetts, US). The libraries were sequenced on a 101 bp paired end run on the HiSeq 2000 (Illumina).

Briefly, primary airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells were isolated from 10 white nonsmoking donors with no chronic illness or medication use and from 5 white donors with asthma. ASM cell cultivation was described previously (26, 28). Passages 4–7 ASM cells maintained in Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and CaCl2 and buffered with HEPES, penicillin-streptomycin, primocin, and additional l-glutamine were used in all experiments. The F-12 medium was used for culture because it provides Ca2+ concentrations that enable visualization of the contractility of muscles in that medium. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Sciences, Inc.). Approximately 1 μg of RNA from each sample was used to generate RNA-Seq cDNA libraries for sequencing using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, Inc.). Sequencing of 75-bp paired-end reads was performed with an Illumina HiSequation 2000 instrument at Partners Personalized Medicine. taffeta scripts (https://github.com/blancahimes/taffeta) were used to analyze RNA-Seq data, which included using trimmomatic (v.0.32) (29) for trimming of adapters and FastQC (v.0.11.2; Babraham Bioinformatics) to obtain overall QC metrics. kallisto software was used to estimate transcript counts according to the hg38 Ensembl reference human genome (30).

In both these models a 80–100% mortality is reached within two weeks, with the majority of deaths occurring between days 4–631. Fungal load was determined using the quantitation of 18 s rRNA normalized to host β-actin mRNA via RT-qPCR (Supplementary Figure S1). We detected varying levels of 18 s rRNA across all normalized sample replicates; however samples with relatively low normalized levels produced substantial burden (1,752 ng of 18 s rRNA per ng of host β-actin). Total RNA was utilized for subsequent library preparation via Oligo-dT beads that capture polyA tails to generate a cDNA library of the coding transcriptome without strand information. Library sequencing via HiSeq-2500, mapping, and quality control filtration of reads resulted in approximately 16 M to 29 M paired end reads per sample replicate (Supplementary Table S1). Approximately 98% of mapped reads aligned to mouse genes, while (50,000 to 1.1 M) paired end reads mapped to A. fumigatus strain A1163 genes per sample replicate. The vast majority of mapped mouse reads corresponded to exonic regions (>83%), while ~10% and ~2% mapped to intronic and intergenic regions. Reads mapped to A. fumigatus were >75% for exonic regions, ~4% for intronic regions, and 20% for intergenic regions. Cufflinks/CummeRbund and HTSeq. 2/DeSeq. 2 based pipelines were employed to determine FPKM and count distribution, covariance between samples, fold difference in expression (log2 fold change > 1), and cut-off values for statistical significance (q-value < 0.05, FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05) for mouse and fungal genes respectively (Supplementary Files S1,6, Supplementary Table S4, Supplementary Figure S2)."
33382850,deseq2,"To further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the changes in phenotypes observed in the MCF10A cells by the LMP1 modified EVs, RNA-seq was performed on the recipient cells. In normal physiological condition or tumor microenvironment, cells are constantly exposed to EVs circulating which can be taken up by these cells and rewire the cells towards a different phenotype [59]. To depict this, MCF10A cells were exposed to HK1 WT EVs, HK1 LMP1 EVs or PBS for 48 hours, new EVs were added every 24 hours before harvesting the cells and isolating RNA for library preparation (Fig 6A). Differential expressed genes were screened with DESeq2 by comparing all against the control group (PBS). HK1 WT and HK1 LMP1 EVs statistically upregulated about 179 transcripts and downregulated 235 transcripts in the MCF10A cells comparing with the control (Fig 6B) (S3 Data). Heatmap representation showed individual genes were differentially expressed among the three different groups (Fig 6C). Comparison of the differentially expressed transcripts between cells treated with HK1 WT EVs and HK1 LMP1 EVs revealed 80 upregulated and 87 downregulated transcripts (S3A Fig). Canonical pathways analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed an enrichment and potential function in cell cycle, cellular growth and proliferation, cell death and survival and cancer (Fig 6D). Cellular expression of LMP1 has been shown to induce cell growth, promote cell survival and suppress cell apoptosis depending on levels of expression [70]. Further analysis of the differentiated expressed genes clustered into four groups based on their expression level comparing to the control group (Table 1)."

Codon usage in the A-site of paused ribosomes were identified as described by Ishimura et al. (38) with the following changes: First, bam files were merged and offsets were calculated with functions derived from riboWaltz (41). P-sites were mapped for all reads belonging to transcripts with an average of 0.5 reads/codon, again with functionalities derived from riboWaltz. Finally, pause strength P was calculated as a z-score model assuming a poisson distribution of reads, where Z = (read density at codon I – max(background)/(max(background) × 0.5) with a custom python script (Scott Adamson, Jeffrey Chuang (UConn/The Jackson Laboratory), (38)). All codons with P ≥ 10 were taken into account. Codons were ranked by how often pausing was observed. For observed/expected, all transcripts with reads were used without minimal criteria for coverage. E-, P- and A-sites were mapped, again with functionalities derived from riboWaltz. The frequency of codons in the A-site was compared to the hypothetical frequency of these codons according to their occurrence in the transcriptome (observed/expected) with a custom python script (Scott Adamson, Jeffrey Chuang (UConn/The Jackson Laboratory), (38)).

29942250,cuffdiff,"More than 100 million reads were obtained per sample with a uniform distribution of reads across samples (Figure ​Figure3B3B). FASTQ sequencing reads obtained were aligned to the annotated UCSC human genome (GRCh37/hg19) using HISAT2, RRID: SCR_015530 (Version-2.0.5) (Kim et al., 2015). These aligned SAM files were converted to BAM files using SAMtools (Version- 1.3) (Li et al., 2009). The resulting alignment data were then fed to CuffDiff2, RRID: SCR_001647, a software package that takes the reads aligned in BAM format as input, and uses geometric normalization on gene-length normalized read counts (FPKM, fragments per kilo base of exon per million reads), a beta negative binomial model for distribution of reads and t -test, for calling differentially expressed genes (Trapnell et al., 2012 ; Seyednasrollah et al., 2015). We set a corrected p -value, referred to as the q -value cut-off of 0.05 and Fold change > / = 1.5(+/-) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by this method. Read counts for each transcript or exon were also calculated independently using the Python based package HTSeq (Version 0.9.1) (Anders et al., 2015). These read counts were used as inputs for differential analysis with DESeq, RRID: SCR_000154 (Anders et al., 2015) and EdgeR (Empirical analysis of digital gene expression in R), RRID: SCR_012802 (Anders and Huber, 2010 ; Robinson et al., 2010), two R based Bioconductor software packages that analyze the read counts per transcript per sample and normalize them using the method of Trimmed Mean of M -values (TMM) for removing genes with very low read counts. DEGs were identified by fitting the values obtained in a negative binomial model, with variance and mean linked by local regression (Anders and Huber, 2010 ; Robinson et al., 2010 ; Lin et al., 2016). A fold change of 1.5 (+/-) and a p -value of 0.05 in DESeq and an FDR p -value of 0.05 were set as the cut-off in EdgeR. Genes found to be significantly altered by all the three differential gene expression analysis methods were considered further. Significantly up and downregulated genes were separately subjected to a gene ontology based gene enrichment analysis tool, DAVID (Version 6.8) (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) (Dennis et al., 2003) and FunRich (Functional enrichment analysis tool) (Pathan et al., 2015), using the human genome as the background gene set. After converting the input gene IDs to corresponding DAVID gene IDs, the Functional Annotation Tool was used for gene enrichment analysis, based on the DAVID knowledge base. Fisher’s exact p -value method was employed to measure gene-enrichment in DAVID, with a P -value cut-off of 0.1 and the count threshold kept at 2 to speculate maximum information. Most significant biological pathways (GO level 5) enriched in DAVID have been reported as bar graphs. Gene enrichment analysis was also performed using the human Gene Ontology database, HPRD2 and FunRich (Pathan et al., 2015).

27050516,limma,"To determine whether a H/L ratio for a phosphosite changed significantly with CA treatment across replicates, we employed an empirical Bayes statistical approach using the limma software package (Ritchie et al., 2015). An empirical Bayesian framework allowed for the calculation of adjusted p-values for each phosphosite (Fig. 2B). This approach can account for experiment-specific differences, which is advantageous compared to more arbitrary approaches, such as a universal fold-change cutoff (Margolin et al., 2009). We found that more phosphosite ratios decreased than increased upon CA treatment, as expected with targeted kinase inhibition for a short amount of time. This is shown by a higher number of data points on the left side of the volcano plot compared to the right side, using an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.1 (Fig. 2B; see also Supplemental Note)."

The resulting reads were mapped against GRCh38.p5 using TopHat2 version 2.1.1(29). TopHat uses Bowtie, which is based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform algorithm, for sequence alignment and allows for mapping across exon junctions(25). Read counts for each gene were created using HTSeq-Count from the HTSeq package version 0.6.1p1 and Gencode v23 as the annotation(30,31). Custom perl scripts were used for estimation of transcript abundances based on fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM). The differential expression analysis was carried out using the DESeq2 package (version 1.12.3) in R/Bioconductor (R version 3.3.1)(32). DESeq2 fits a generalized linear model (GLM) of the negative binomial family, and a Wald test is performed to evaluate the significance of the coefficients. To define broad pathway responses, gene expression changes in the paired biopsies were assessed using KEGG, GO and pathway analysis IPA and GeneGo.

Each library was then labeled with a unique barcode sequence and high-throughput sequencing was performed using SOLiD technology (Life Technologies). Sequence mapping was performed using a modified version of the SOLiD SAGE Analysis Software v1.10 (Life Technologies) and defined analysis parameters. Sequenced reads were aligned using the mouse transcriptome RefSeq mRNA database and genome build GRCm38/mm10. Tag hits, i.e., successfully aligned reads, were normalized according to DESeq by estimating the size factor for each sample and dividing the sample counts by the corresponding size factor. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq R/Bioconductor package [33].

30122553,cuffdiff,"Previous studies have identified cell lines that differ in their sensitivity to glutamine starvation, as measured by induction of cell death (Cetinbas et al., 2016). A survey of a number of cancer cell lines reproduced this variation, showing that some cells (such as the colon cancer line HCT116) survived and continued to proliferate (albeit much more slowly) while others (e.g., the colon cancer line RKO) rapidly lost viability without glutamine (Figure 1A). To assess how cells that can adapt to glutamine starvation respond to this stress, we carried out RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in wild-type p53-expressing HCT116 cells grown in medium containing all amino acids or without glutamine for 48 hr. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) conducted on the CuffDiff differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate ≤ 0.05) revealed TP53 as the most significantly enriched upstream regulator in the IPA analysis (p value of enrichment = 3.10 × 10−69); additionally, the directionality of the changes in expression of its downstream targets suggest that it is highly activated (activation Z score = 6.63) (Figure 1B). These results are consistent with a previous report showing activation of p53 in response to glutamine starvation in mouse embryo fibroblasts (Reid et al., 2013). The observed increase in p53 levels and phosphorylation, and expression of the p53 target gene p21 (Figure 1C), demonstrated the activation of a p53 response, which was transient, declining as the cells resumed proliferation. To establish the importance of p53 in this response, we generated independent p53-null HCT116 lines that failed to proliferate and showed decreased viability under glutamine starvation (Figures 1D and 1E). An alternative way to limit glutamine metabolism is by using a GLS inhibitor to block the production of glutamate from glutamine. Cells lacking p53 were more sensitive to CB-839, a GLS1 inhibitor (Gross et al., 2014), than wild-type p53-expressing cells, although the inhibitor slowed the proliferation of both cell types (Figure 1F) in vitro. In vivo, wild-type HCT116 xenografts were not affected by treatment of mice with CB-839 (Figure 1G), while the growth of p53-null HCT116 xenograft tumors was somewhat decreased in response to glutaminase inhibition (Figure 1H). This difference in sensitivity was not due to differential efficacy of the inhibitor, as there was a similar and substantial reduction in the ratio of glutamate to glutamine in both wild-type and p53-null tumors (Figure 1I)."

RPKM (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads) was calculated by Cuffnorm55. For m6A Seq, the same method was used56. Briefly, the longest isoform was used if multiple isoforms were detected. Aligned reads were extended to 150 bp (average fragment size) and converted from genome-based coordinates to isoform-based coordinates in order to eliminate the interference from an intron in peak calling. To call m6A peaks, the longest isoform of each mouse gene was scanned using a 100-bp sliding window with 10-bp steps. To reduce bias from potential inaccurate gene structure annotation and the arbitrary usage of the longest isoform, windows with reads counts less than 1/20 of the top window in both m6A IP and input sample were excluded. For each gene, the reads count in each window was normalized by the median count of all windows of that gene. A negative binomial model was used to identify the differential windows between IP and input samples by using the edgeR package57. The window was called as positive if FDR < 1% and log2(enrichment score) ≥ 1 in both replicates. Overlapping positive windows were merged. The following four numbers were calculated to obtain the enrichment score of each peak (or window): read count of the IP sample in the current peak/window (a), median read count of the IP sample in all 100-bp windows on the current mRNA (b), read count of the input sample in the current peak/window (c), and median read count of the input sample in all 100-bp windows on the current mRNA (d), the enrichment score of each window was calculated as (a) × (d)/(b) × (c).

We removed the sequencing reads with adaptor contamination and low‐quality bases (quality score < Q30) via Trimmomatic (v0.35) to clean and advance the quality of the reads. All sequence data were 2 × 100 bp in length. The high‐quality reads were saved in fastq files and deposited to NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus under GEO Series accession number {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GSE123017"",""term_id"":""123017""}}GSE123017. Clean and high‐quality data were utilized for all downstream analysis. We used STAR aligner (v2.5.3) to generate genome indexes and mapping reads to the reference genomes that are hg38 for human cell line samples and GRCm38.p5 for mouse cell line samples. At the mapping step, reads having the non‐canonical junctions were removed and only uniquely mapping reads were utilized. Following the alignment, Pearson's correlation analysis was conducted to obtain the transcript‐level R
2 value between replicates. To determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we utilized Cuffdiff with a minimum alignment count of 10, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. The absolute value of |Fold change| ≥ 2 and q‐value < 0.05 was used as the threshold to judge significant differences in gene expression. DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 88, 89 was utilized to determine the statistical enrichment of the significantly (P < 0.05) differentially expressed genes in KEGG pathways and GO‐enrichment analysis.

To estimate the expression levels, the trimmed RNA sequences were aligned to the B73 reference genome version 2 annotated with genes and transcripts [15]. Read alignment was performed using the criteria: similarity and length fraction = 0.8, mismatch cost = 2, deletion and insertion costs = 3 and maximum number of hit per read = 10. Gene expression levels were estimated as transcripts per million (TPM) [21] which was calculated as: TPM = (RPKM × 106) / Σ RPKM, where the sum is over the RPKM values of all genes/transcripts.

Strains growing exponentially in YPD medium at 30°C were harvested by vacuum filtration at room temperature, and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed in a freezer mill with lysis buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 140 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton, 500 μg/mL cycloheximide). For ribosome footprint library preparation, approximately 60 A260 units of extract were treated with RNAse I at 15 U per OD260 unit (Ambion, #AM2295) for 1h at 25°C on a Thermomixer at 700 rpm, and 80S ribosomes were purified by sedimentation through a sucrose density gradient as described [49]. Ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (footprints) were purified by phenol and chloroform extractions [49]. Following size selection and dephosphorylation, a Universal miRNA cloning linker (Synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies) was ligated to the 3’ ends of footprints, followed by reverse transcription, circular ligation, rRNA subtraction, PCR amplification of the cDNA library, and DNA sequencing with an Illumina HiSeq system. For RNA-Seq library preparation, total RNA was purified using miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) from aliquots of the same extracts (30 OD260 units) used for footprint library preparation, 5 μg total RNA was randomly fragmented at 70°C for 12 min in fragmentation reagent (Ambion #AM8740). Fragment size selection, library generation and sequencing were carried out as above, except Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit (Yeast) was employed to remove rRNAs after linker-ligation in lieu of poly(A) selection. As described [48], linker sequences were trimmed from Illumina reads and the trimmed fasta sequences were aligned to the S. cerevisiae ribosomal database using Bowtie [50]. The non-rRNA reads (unaligned reads) were then mapped to the S. cerevisiae genome using TopHat [51]. Wiggle track normalization for viewing RPF or RNA reads in the IGV browser was conducted as follows. Wiggle files were produced from the alignment file, one each for genes on the Watson or Crick strand. The total reads on both strands were summed and a normalization factor q was calculated as 1,000,000,000/(total reads on W+C strands). Wiggle files were then regenerated by multiplying all reads by the factor q, yielding the number of reads per 1,000 million total reads (rpkm). Statistical analysis of changes in mRNA, RPFs, or TE values between two replicates each of any two strains being compared was conducted using DESeq2 [52], excluding any genes with less than 10 total mRNA reads in the 4 samples combined."

Briefly, libraries were constructed from poly-adenylated RNAs and sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 2500 on an SR-50 run aiming for 30M reads/sample. Reads were aligned to the mm10 mouse transcriptome using TopHat and differential gene expression was determined using Cuffdiff as previously described34. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using software available from the Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea), which tested for enrichment based on hypergeometric distribution with respect to published gene signatures. For hypoxia regulated gene signature, GSEA plots comparing a gene set pre-ranked by log2 fold change in gene expression (GL7+ B220+ vs GL7− B220+) to a hypoxia signature published by Eustace et al35. A significant enrichment was defined as having an FDR q value ≤0.05.

Quality trimmed reads were aligned using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) (version 2.2.8) to the P. aeruginosa PAO1 reference genome to identify known genes and calculated gene expression by RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). The gene expression level was calculated and further normalized by using the fragments per kb of transcript per million (FPKM) mapped reads method to eliminate the influence of different gene lengths and amount of sequencing data on the calculation of gene expression. The edgeR package2 was used to identify DEGs across samples with fold changes ≥2 and a false discovery rate-adjusted P (q value) <0.05.

High-throughput sequencing were performed on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing system using standard run, following the protocol recommended by Illumina for sequencing mRNA samples. Sequencing was undertaken for each biological replicate at 1 × 51 bp (Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research; Toronto, Canada). RNA-seq results were analyzed, as previously described18. Briefly, differential gene expression was assessed using EdgeR’s (version 3.12.1)43,44 general linear model likelihood ratio test and FDR-corrected p < 0.05 was considered significant. qPCR validation correlated 93% with RNAseq findings (Supplementary Fig. 2). Genotype permutations (1000) were computed in Broad Institute’s Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)45,46 to determine FDR, nominal p- value, and normalized enrichment score (NES) of each gene set. Gene sets with FDR ≤ 0.25, p ≤ 0.01, and NES ≥ 1.6 met significance thresholds18. While GSEA provides insight into how the expression of genes from an individual pathway are altered, over-representation analysis indicates whether there are more genes in a set that are related to an individual pathway than would be expected by chance. ConsensusPathDB was used to perform over-representation analysis of significantly differentially expressed genes47; enrichment with a p-value < 0.001, FDR < 0.05 was considered significant. qRT-PCR validations were run using cDNA that was made by SensiFAST cDNA synthesis kit (Bioline, London, England). qRT-PCR was run in triplicate (SensiFAST SYBER Hi-ROX 20 μl reaction, Bioline) and quantified by a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad).

The aim of this work was to explore the genome function to better understand the underlying physiological mechanisms associated with body fat accretion. Dorsal subcutaneous fat samples were collected at slaughter from adult animals (n = 4 for each breed) with ~150 kg body weight. Total RNA was obtained and sequenced for transcriptome analysis using DESeq2. A total of 458 differentially expressed (DE) genes (q-value < 0.05) were identified, with 263 overexpressed in AL and 195 in BI. Key genes involved in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, elongation and desaturation were upregulated in AL such as ACLY, FASN, ME1, ELOVL6 and SCD. A functional enrichment analysis of the DE genes was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Cholesterol synthesis is suggested to be higher in AL via SREBF2, SCAP and PPARG, while lipolytic activity may be more active in BI through GH and AMPK signalling.

We then used rMATS (version3.0.8) (62) to identify differential alternative splicing (AS) events between the two sample groups corresponding to all five basic types of AS patterns. Briefly, rMATS uses a modified version of the generalized linear mixed model to detect differential AS from RNA-seq data with replicates, while controlling for changes in overall gene expression levels. It accounts for exon-specific sequencing coverage in individual samples as well as variation in exon splicing levels among replicates. For each AS event, we used both the reads mapped to the splice junctions and the reads mapped to the exon body as the input for rMATS.

Differential expression analyses were conducted using the limma-voom Bioconductor pipeline (32) to compare the transcriptome profiles of antigen-experienced CD4 subsets to those of naive cells. Principal-component analysis of the 500 most variable genes based on coefficients of variation showed that CD4 transcriptomes clustered by cellular differentiation status, with memory CD4 T cells (both CXCR5+ and CXCR5−) sharing transcriptional signatures relative to naive and Tfh subsets (data not shown). To extract information on biologically relevant gene sets, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with the goal of determining biological pathways that were enriched in Tfh cells in the Th1 vaccine regimen. Genes regulating interleukin-12 (IL-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and IL-6 production were strongly enriched in Tfh cells.

Venn-Diagram method was used to compare and visualize datasets of experimental groups with the three different Bioconductor approaches (36). For the functional annotation of the transcripts, Sma3s, AutoFact, and Full-LengtherNext were used to provide gene description (37–39). These annotation tools were consulted from SoleaDB transcriptome database (30).

26821746,cufflinks,"To annotate lncRNAs in human granulocytes we collected samples from five male and five female healthy individuals of varying ages under standardized sampling conditions and sequenced polyadenylated (PolyA+) RNA (Fig. 1a, b, Additional file 1: Figure S1A and Supplemental Methods, Additional file 2A). Ribosome-depleted RNA-seq, used for expression and splicing efficiency analysis, was performed for seven donors (4 male donors, 3 female donors) at three time points. To annotate lncRNAs we aligned the PolyA+ RNA-seq data with STAR [56] to obtain 757 million uniquely-mapped reads of which 187.6 million were spliced (Additional file 2B, C) and performed de novo transcriptome assembly using Cufflinks and Cuffmerge [57]. The term ‘de novo’ is used for transcripts/loci identified in this transcriptome assembly pipeline. Only multi-exonic transcripts longer than 200 base pairs (bp) were retained and several filtering steps applied to remove potential assembly artifacts (Additional file 1: Figure S1). We next extracted multi-exonic transcripts overlapping exons annotated as protein-coding in GENCODE-v19 [58] and RefSeq [59] and used them later to generate a de novo protein-coding granulocyte mRNA annotation. We discarded annotated GENCODE-v19 pseudogene transcripts. To remove potential protein/peptide-coding transcripts, we estimated transcript protein-coding capability using RNAcode [60] and CPC [61]. We adjusted the criteria for the output of the protein-coding potential estimation pipeline (RNAcode score <18, CPC score <1.6) by analyzing well-known lncRNAs (Additional file 2D). We validated these criteria by applying the pipeline to the above public annotations; this identified the majority of annotated lncRNAs as non-protein-coding, whereas the majority of mRNAs were identified as protein-coding (Additional file 1:Figure S1E). To avoid confusion in later expression analysis we removed all lncRNAs overlapping a protein-coding gene in sense direction (for example, intronic lncRNAs) from our analysis. The final de novo lncRNA granulocyte annotation comprised 1,591 lncRNA loci (Additional file 3) expressing 6,249 lncRNA transcripts (Additional file 4) with a mean of 3.9 transcript isoforms per locus, consistent with previous observations [14]. De novo lncRNA transcripts contained 13,058 unique exons from 5,612 non-overlapping exonic regions. Protein-coding mRNAs were de novo annotated in preference to using the public annotations to avoid technical bias when comparing lncRNAs to mRNAs and to assess the quality of our annotation (Additional file 1: Figure S2). The de novo granulocyte mRNA annotation comprised 10,092 mRNA loci (Additional file 5) expressing 132,864 transcripts (Additional file 6) with a mean of 13.2 transcripts per locus, consistent with previous observations [62]. We assigned de novo annotated lncRNAs into three position-based classes relative to the nearest protein-coding gene (Fig. 1c).

33203368,cuffdiff,"Since PS has previously been described as a drought-tolerant cultivar [35, 39, 47], and showed better tolerance to drought than AH and NP, such cultivar was assessed to get insights into the molecular mechanisms that could contribute to its tolerance, as a first approach, the transcriptome of aerial tissues on this common bean cultivar was examined using the RNA-Seq technology. The total number of preprocessed reads, with an average read length of 36 bp, ranged from 51 to 56 million (Table 1). Then, reads were aligned to the P. vulgaris reference genome with TopHat/Bowtie, a fast splice junction mapper proper for short reads. A high percentage of uniquely mapped reads were obtained, whereas reads that did not map were low (Table ​(Table1).1). In the case of the control condition, 91.7% of the reads were uniquely mapped in the genome, whereas 93.5% were mapped in the drought condition (Table ​(Table1).1). Expression levels of genes were determined using Cuffdiff, taking into account the FPKM values (Additional file 4: Fig. S4). Overall, 1005 putative differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, from which 645 genes were found to be up-regulated by the drought treatment, whereas 360 were down-regulated (Table ​(Table11 and Additional file 5: Table S1). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses for some selected DEGs according to the Functional association networks (see below) were performed for validation (Fig. 3 and Additional file 6: Fig. S5). Accordingly, PYL4, XTH6, CESA4, and CSLD5, which were found to be up-regulated in the RNA-Seq data, were confirmed as induced in the RT-PCR analysis (Fig. ​(Fig.33 and Additional file 6: Fig. S5). On the other hand, the expression of HSP70, HSFA2, FTSH6, and HYH, which were down-regulated genes in the dataset, were reduced in the drought stress condition as assessed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3 and Additional file 6: Fig. S5). Some of these DEGs were also tested in the other two cultivars of common bean, namely AH and NP, showing a similar response mainly for up-regulated genes (Additional file 7: Fig. S6). As RNA samples for semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays were different from those used for RNAseq, but from independent experiments under the same control and drought stress conditions, this independent verification supports the reproducibility and reliability of our transcriptome analysis, and validates the RNA-seq data. Altogether, the RNA-Seq analysis shows that multiple genes of PS are modulated by drought stress.

24151245,cufflinks,"Equal amounts of RNA from the distal or proximal colon from individual rats were pooled, and the two samples were used for high-throughput sequencing. A total of 150 million (74 million proximal and 76 million distal colon) 40 bp single-end Illumina reads were obtained from a multiplexing run on a single lane. Reads were filtered for adapter sequences and trimmed based on sequence quality (threshold of Q20) using ea-utils toolkit (https://code.google.com/p/ea-utils/). Filtered reads <20 bp in length were discarded. Spliced alignment was performed against the rat genome (rn4) using tophat2 (48) without allowing any mismatches to reduce the number of false positives and the resultant alignments were further processed with cufflinks2 (40) to perform reference annotation-based transcript assembly with bias and multiread correction. Differential expression analyses were performed with cuffdiff2 and cummeRbund (49). The cuffcompare program of cufflinks2 pipeline (reference annotation-based method) was used to classify the assembled transfrags into different classes. The transfrags annotated with class codes u (unknown intergenic transcript) and i (a transfrag falling entirely within a reference intron) were selected to annotate against known lncRNAs. A custom perl script was written to fetch sequences for the coordinate information produced by cuffcompare. NONCODE v3, UCSC, and fRNAdb v3.0 databases were downloaded and only noncoding RNA (ncRNA) sequences belonging to the rat genome whose length was >100 bp were used to create a unified database (6, 27, 29). The fetched sequences from UCSC were then queried for ncRNA sequence similarity with blastn by thresholding at 1e-10 (3, 21). High confidence hits, % with high-scoring segment pair length >100 and whose identity was >95% were retained. Whenever possible, BLAST results were further filtered to remove hits that did not correspond to known ncRNA coordinate information. Due to the consistent lack of coordinate information for the known ncRNA sequences, the results include matches to multiple genomic locations."

Home-cage mice were not subjected to training, but dissected simultaneously with trained mice to account for time of the day differences. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with additional on-column DNase I digestion according to the manufacturer’s instructions and 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was used for RNA-seq. Both differential gene expression (DEG) and differential alternative splicing (DAS) expression analysis was performed by GATC Biotech (Inview Transcriptome Discover, GATC Biotech AG, Constance, Germany) as previously described [21, 32]. In brief, paired-end sequencing libraries prepared from total RNA (see above) were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000 platform. After removal of poor quality and single reads without mates, reads were aligned to the GRCm38/mm10 mouse genome assembly with TopHat/Bowtie [33] guided by the Ensembl v85 transcript annotation, yielding between ~ 73 and 101 million mapped reads per sample. Differential gene expression (DEG) analysis was conducted using Cufflinks/Cuffdiff [34] which computes per gene FPKM values to then test for differential expression between conditions. Differential alternative splicing (DAS) analysis was conducted using multivariate analysis of transcript splicing (MATS) [32]. TopHat/Bowtie aligned reads were used as input for MATS which compares splicing patterns by considering exon-exon junction read counts for transcript variants of a gene. For differential alternative splicing and statistical testing, MATS relies on a multivariate uniform prior to model the between-sample correlation in exon splicing patterns, and a Markov chain Monte Carlo method coupled with a simulation-based adaptive sampling procedure to calculate the p-values and false discovery rates (FDR). A Padjusted < 0.05 (FDR adjusted P-value) was used as a cut-off for DAS events. DASs above the cutoff were analyzed for enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms and pathways using database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) v6.8 (Huang da, Sherman, & Lempicki, 2009a, 2009b). Default settings of DAVID were chosen except that the background database was restricted to the pool of genes annotated in our RNA-seq analysis [21]. Only gene enriched terms with a -log10 P-value < 3 (pvalue < 0.001) were considered significant. Delta “percent spliced in” (ΔPSI) distribution for two groups considered only DAS events detectable in both conditions tested as DAS events detected only in one of the comparisons were not categorized as unique or common in Figs. 2e and ​and4e.4e.

22988074,deseq,"In order to establish the global effects of 1 in a xenograft setting, we measured changes in gene expression using RNA-seq in tumors from treated and untreated mice (see Materials and Methods for details). As our RNA-seq libraries contained a mixture of human and mouse RNA derived from the xenograft as well as the host cells infiltrating it, we faced the challenge of accurately determining the transcripts and genes from which sequencing reads originate (Table S2 and discussion in the SI Text). We therefore designed an analysis pipeline based upon mapping reads to a combined human and mouse transcriptome and using the recently developed eXpress software package (bio.math.berkeley.edu/eXpress/index.html) to quantify probabilistically transcript abundance for both species simultaneously (Fig. 4). The eXpress output was used as input for differential expression analysis using DESeq (16)."

Here, mis-annotated loci were considered as loci assembled by Cufflinks but spanning two or more loci annotated in the soybean genome assembly. This is often due to the incorrect annotation of the initial gene model or annotated genes being too close together to be resolved. Unannotated loci (i.e., the novel loci) are an assembled group of reads not overlapping with any known loci annotated in the soybean genome assembly. Among the DEGs that have been annotated previously, 270 were up-regulated and 195 were down-regulated by short-term Pi deprivation (Figure S2). Interestingly, transcripts from nine DEGs were found only in PDL, while transcripts from 12 DEGs were found only in PSL (Table 1).

Further bioinformatics processing was performed using the CLC Genomics Workbench (version 7.0; CLCbio, Aarhus, Denmark). fastq files were imported as high-throughput data and trimmed for quality (quality, 0.001; ambiguous, 2: discard, min 30, max 100) and to remove adapter sequences. After trimming, the remaining reads that mapped to stable RNAs (16S, 23S, and 5S rRNA and all tRNAs) were removed (similarity, 0.9; length, 0.85; mismatch, 2; insertion, 3; deletion, 3; global alignment and stand-alone read). The remaining reads were then mapped to the genome for RNA-seq analyses (mapping parameters, 0.9; length, 0.85; mismatch, 2; insertion, 3; deletion, 3; maximum number of hits for a read, 10). The mapped reads were normalized using the default settings, and differentially expressed genes identified using empirical analysis of differential gene expression (EDGE test) (36). Genes showing fold expression changes greater than 4 or less than −4 with P values of <0.01 were considered to be differentially expressed."
28804485,deseq2,"Our previous transcriptomic analysis of Glossina palpalis gambiensis experimentally infected or not with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense aimed to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with infection. Specifically, we selected candidate genes governing tsetse fly vector competence that could be used in the context of an anti-vector strategy, to control human and/or animal trypanosomiasis. The present study aimed to verify whether gene expression in field tsetse flies (G. p. palpalis) is modified in response to natural infection by trypanosomes (T. congolense), as reported when insectary-raised flies (G. p. gambiensis) are experimentally infected with T. b. gambiense. This was achieved using the RNA-seq approach, which identified 524 DEGs in infected vs. non-infected tsetse flies, including 285 downregulated genes and 239 upregulated genes (identified using DESeq2). Several of these genes were highly differentially expressed, with log2 fold change values in the vicinity of either +40 or −40. Downregulated genes were primarily involved in transcription/translation processes, whereas encoded upregulated genes governed amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways. The BioCyc metabolic pathways associated with infection also revealed that downregulated genes were mainly involved in fly immunity processes. Importantly, our study demonstrates that data on the molecular cross-talk between the host and the parasite (as well as the always present fly microbiome) recorded from an experimental biological model has a counterpart in field flies, which in turn validates the use of experimental host/parasite couples."
31245703,cufflinks,"Genes were identified via a reference annotation‐based transcript assembly method using the Cufflinks package (Roberts, Pimentel, Trapnell, & Pachter, 2011; Trapnell et al., 2010). Reads from SH and YK were assembled separately and then merged using the cuffmerge command (Roberts et al., 2011; Trapnell et al., 2010). The intersect function within BEDTools v2.17.0 was used to identify genes not annotated in the JGI E. salsugineum genome (newly annotated genes). Same strandedness was not enforced when identifying newly annotated genes because of the nonstrand‐specific protocol for 454 library preparation. Newly annotated genes that are unique from or overlap genes annotated by Champigny et al. (2013) but are present in the JGI reference genome were also identified using the same method (Table S1)."
28616073,deseq,"The growth phenotypes observed in the Δpdr-1 mutant implied that multiple pectin-related metabolic processes are impaired. To assess the PDR-1 regulon, the transcriptional profile of N. crassa WT and Δpdr-1 strains was determined by RNA-seq after a 4 h incubation on medium with no carbon source (NoC), 2 mM l-Rha, or 1% citrus peel pectin. The RNA-seq data were used for differential expression (DEseq) analysis. Initially, the DEseq analysis of WT grown on pectin or L-Rha versus NoC showed that most of the genes predicted to be involved in pectin degradation were significantly upregulated (fold change ≥3) on pectin (Table 1). Next, all genes that were more than threefold upregulated in the WT or Δpdr-1 strain on either pectin or l-Rha in comparison to NoC were matched against each other by creating a Venn diagram (Additional file 1: Figure S3A, Additional file 2: Tables S1, S2). A custom catalogue based on the MIPS Functional Catalogue Database (FunCatDB) [40] with expanded categories for cell wall degradation-related genes was used for a follow-up enrichment analysis. Functional categories were determined for each group (bin) of the Venn diagram with more than 20 genes. Categories with a p value ≤5 × 10−5 were deemed as significantly enriched (Additional file 2: Tables S3, S4).

Similarly, several immune-related genes, such as Cd14 (Fig. 2D) and secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (Slpi), were up-regulated in Sham compared to Control mice, and reversed in VSG mice (Fig. 3C). We also identified differentially expressed genes between Control and Sham mice (FDR 10% DESeq2; Supplementary Table 3). The down-regulated genes in Sham compared to Control mice are enriched for metabolic pathways, including linoleic acid metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 3A), which were up-regulated in VSG compared to Sham (Fig. 3B). The up-regulated genes in Sham compared to Control mice were enriched for inflammatory and immune response (Supplementary Fig. 3B), which were down-regulated in VSG compared to Sham mice (Fig. 3D). This correspondence of pathways further indicates that VSG can reverse diet-induced transcriptome changes."

Raw sequence reads were aligned to a reference genome (mm10) using Bowtie version 1.1.1 (Langmead et al., 2009) using ‘-m 1’ and ‘--best’ parameters to ensure reporting of uniquely mapped reads. Tag directories were generated using ‘makeTagDirectory’ using the -tbp 1 option to limit the number of reads starting at the same position to 1. ChIP-seq peaks were identified and analyzed using HOMER (Heinz et al., 2010). ChIP-seq peaks were identified in HOMER using the ‘getDifferentialPeaksReplicates.pl’ command, specifying ‘-style factor’ to generate a high confidence set of peaks across triplicate samples. This command generates a peak list in three steps: first, it pools target tag directories to perform an initial peak identification against input; second, it quantifies raw reads of each target and input tag directory at the initial putative peaks; third, it calls DESeq2 to calculate enrichment values for each peak using the individual raw counts and returns only those peaks that pass two fold enrichment and FDR < 0.05.

This produced approximately 20 million single end 75 base pair reads per sample. All data analysis was conducted using the Sun Grid Engine on the Newton High Performance Computing cluster at the University of Tennessee‐Knoxville. The quality of the reads was analyzed using FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics, Cambridge, UK). The reference Synechocystis sp.

The quality of the trimmed reads was then analyzed using FastQC and then indexed and mapped to the reference genome using Bowtie2 and Tophat (Langmead & Salzberg, 2012; Langmead, Trapnell, Pop, & Salzberg, 2009). Over 90% of the total reads were successfully mapped to the genome in each sample. The BAM files produced from Tophat were first sorted then converted to SAM format files. The mapped reads were then sorted and counted using SamTools and HTSeq (Anders, Pyl, & Huber, 2015). The read counts were loaded into R, and differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (Love, Huber, & Anders, 2014).

The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 4000 platform and 150 bp paired‐end reads were generated. Three independent biological replicates of each sample were sequenced separately. The raw sequence reads were cleaned by removing bases with low quality score and cutting sequencing adapter followed by filtering out short reads (Supporting Information Table S6). The cleaned reads were mapped to the TAIR10 Arabidopsis genome using TopHat v2.0.4 with default settings, except that a minimum intron length of 20 bp and a maximum intron length of 4,000 bp were used.

Quality of RNA was assessed using the Agilent BioAnalyzer (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip) at the Centre for Applied Genomics (TCAG) at the Hospital for Sick Children. Whole-transcriptome analysis by RNA-sequencing was performed at TCAG at the Hospital for Sick Children using a poly-A selection of mRNA. Paired-end 2 × 125 bp sequencing was performed with Illumina HiSeq 2500 instruments at a sequencing depth of ≈20 million paired reads per sample. Sequence data was demultiplexed and base calls were converted to FASTQ format with bcl2fastq2 v2.20. The sequence read quality was assessed using FastQC v.0.11.5 [48]. Adapter trimming and removal of lower quality ends was performed using Trim Galore v. 0.5.0 [49]. Trimmed reads were screened for presence of rRNA and mtRNA sequences using FastQ-Screen v.0.10.0 [50]. RSeQC package v.2.6.2 [51] was used to confirm strand specific RNA-Seq library construction and to assess positional read duplication and read distribution across exonic, intronic and intergenic regions.

Mapping efficiencies ranged from 81 to 86% for all libraries. HTSeq was used to generate count tables for each library (Anders et al. 2015). Count tables were analyzed for differential expression using the edgeR package in R, which utilizes a negative binomial model to estimate dispersions (Robinson et al. 2010). Detected genes were considered those expressed at a level of at least four counts per million (CPM) across all libraries for all conditions, reducing the number of genes included in the analysis to 8649. The “calcNormFactors” function was used to normalize for RNA composition and the tagwise dispersion estimate was used for differential expression. The exact test was used for pairwise comparisons.

Among these, there were 632 significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs. After hierarchical clustering analysis, we found that, like protein-coding genes, these lncRNAs showed very distinct stage-specific expression patterns, suggesting that they have regulatory roles during female germline development (Fig. 6A). Subsequently, we used RNA-seq data that were directly or indirectly mappable to the mouse reference genome, but had no overlap with sequences in RefSeq, NCBI or Noncode v3.0 lncRNA databases, then carried out de novo transcript assembly using the reference-guided assembly software Cufflinks.46 Finally, we obtained 376 novel lncRNAs.

31188523,limma,"To determine whether spatial control of gene expression occurs in cell protrusions, we analyzed protrusion-enriched mRNAs by combining results from two R packages commonly used for differential gene-expression analysis (limma and samr) and identified 439 genes with at least two-fold increased expression in protrusions (Data file S1 in the Supporting Information). To validate the RNA-Seq results, we carried out RT-qPCR to quantify several protrusion-enriched mRNAs identified by RNA-Seq, including CENPB, RAB13, ZEB1, ANP32B, CORO1A, and PINK1, using ACTB (β-Actin) as a reference gene and ARPC3, a non-enriched gene, as a control. Consistent with the RNA-Seq results, we observed protrusion-localized enrichment of CENPB (2.3-fold), RAB13 (8.1-fold), ZEB1 (1.6-fold), ANP32B (2.0-fold), CORO1A (4.6-fold), and PINK1 (1.7-fold, Figure 4 E). We then performed FISH to image the subcellular localization of specific mRNAs. As shown in Figure 4 F and Figure S8 in the Supporting Information, RAB13 transcripts are prominently localized at the leading edges of cell protrusions, and PINK1 transcripts are also present in the cell protrusions, consistent with our RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR results."

Only reads of final length of 30 nucleotides with correctly sequenced TACAGAGAA consensus motif at position 12-20 and without any Ns were kept for further analysis using R 3.4.3 (R Core Team, 2017) and Bioconductor (Huber et al., 2015). To search for possible preference of human METTL16 for specific structured RNA features, we analyzed the predicted secondary structures of the sequenced oligos and compare their representation in between the m6A-IP and input libraries. For each sequence we obtained the minimum free energy (MFE) secondary structure using RNAfold (Lorenz et al., 2011). We used DESeq2 1.18.1 bioconductor package (Love et al., 2014) to obtain the lists of structures significantly enriched or depleted in IP (immunoprecipitation) libraries when compared to input libraries (adjusted p value < 0.1). Top enriched structures were plotted in dot bracket notation (DBN) (Figures 3E and 3F). To search for preferred features in IP-enriched structures, for every structure and each position based on DBN, we checked whether it is part of the stem, is in a loop, is in a bulge or if it is in between two stems. Then we compared the proportion of the structures having nucleotide at specific position in a stem, loop, etc, in between IP-enriched structures, IP-depleted structures and structures with no difference in their abundance between m6A-IP and input (Figure 3G). In IP-enriched structures we observed a clear preference of A at position 15 (in the motif UACAGAGAA), which is methylated by METTL16, to be in a single nucleotide bulge or to lie in a region surrounded by stem structures (Figure 3G). To see the differences in IP-enriched and depleted structures, we also plotted the log2 difference of the frequencies for IP-enriched (or depleted) structures when related to the structures not differentially represented between m6A IP and input (Figure 3H). While the IP-enriched structures had higher proportion of 15A in a single nucleotide bulge or lying between two stems, the IP-depleted structures showed the opposite trend, with less proportion of structures with 15A in a bulge or in between two stems. For calculations of these log2 ratios of the frequencies, the frequencies lower than 0.5% were considered to be 0.5. Proportion of individual structures in which 15A can be found is summarized in a barplot (Figure 3I). We also directly compared the frequencies of oligos with individual positions in a stem, loop etc. in between m6A-IP libraries and input libraries (Figure S3C) and their log2 ratios, separately for both replicas (Figure S3D). In m6A-IP libraries we observed increased proportion of oligos where 15A is in single nucleotide bulge or in between two stems."

Libraries were equimolarly pooled and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500, resulting in ca. 32–43 million single-end reads per library. After sequencing, FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/) was used to perform a basic quality control on the sequencing data. As an additional control, library diversity was assessed by redundancy investigation in the reads. Next, the reads were aligned with BWA (v.0.7.8) against the mouse reference (mm10) and an exon-exon junction library of 120 nucleotides, which was created according to the Ensembl annotation version 69. The uniquely aligned reads were counted with featureCounts (v.1.4.4) and the same Ensembl annotation. Normalization of the raw read counts based on the library size and testing for differential expression between the two conditions was performed with the DESeq2 (v.1.4.0) R package. Genes with an adjusted p value of less than 0.1 were considered as differentially expressed for comparison. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the DEseq2 R package to compare gene expression levels between Tg6 and WT mice for both HSC and MPP cell types. DEseq gave 6,629 significantly DEGs when comparing Tg and WT mice for HSC cells and 3,801 DEGs for MPP cells (p-adjusted value < 0.1).

32573059,deseq2,"To elucidate the role of NSD2 in protecting cells from senescence, we performed mRNA‐seq in NSD2‐KD IMR‐90 cells at 24 hr after siRNA transfection. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the KEGG platform revealed that eight gene sets were significantly downregulated in NSD2‐KD cells, while no gene set was upregulated (Figure 2a, Figure S2a). The downregulated gene sets included DNA replication, cell cycle, mismatch repair, homologous recombination, base excision repair, and nucleotide excision repair. Analysis of differentially expressed genes by the DESeq2 algorithm identified 124 downregulated and 65 upregulated genes in NSD2‐KD cells (Figure 2b). As shown in unbiased GSEA analysis, the downregulated genes in NSD2‐KD cells were highly enriched for cell cycle‐associated genes and DNA repair genes (Figure S2b). Comparison of transcriptome data between NSD2‐KD, OIS, and RS cells revealed that ~90% (112/124 for OIS and 108/124 for RS) of the downregulated genes and only ~30% (17/65 for OIS and 15/65 for RS) of the upregulated genes in NSD2‐KD cells were consistently upregulated and downregulated in OIS or RS cells, respectively (Figure 2c). qRT‐PCR confirmed the downregulation of cell cycle‐associated genes and DNA repair genes after 24 hr in NSD2‐KD cells (Figure 2d). We also detected the upregulation of CDKN1A/p21 after 24 hr, and the levels of CDKN2A/p16 increased after 6 days in NSD2‐KD cells (Figure 2d, Figure S2c). In addition, despite the downregulation of DNA repair genes, NSD2‐KD cells did not elevate the levels of DNA damage, as indicated by levels of DNA damage‐responsive γH2AX foci formation at 24 hr in NSD2‐KD cells, using the treatment with a topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin as a positive control (Figure S2d). Consistent with these results, the expression levels of SASP genes were not mostly increased in NSD2‐KD cells, compared with those in SETD8‐KD and OIS cells (Figure S2e). These data indicate that loss of NSD2 decreases the expression of cell cycle‐associated genes and DNA repair genes without inducing massive DNA damage and SASP gene expression."

Pretreatment needle core biopsies and surgical tumor resections following 7 day trametinib treatment were subjected to RNAseq. Similar to the TCGA, we used RNAseq by Expectation-Maximization (RSEM) (29) to quantify transcript abundances from RNAseq data. PAM50 subtype calls were made from RNAseq profiles for post and pre-treatment tumor samples for each of the six patients in the window trial (30). Five tumors profiled as basal-like in both post- and pre-trametinib treatment (referred to as BL;BL for post/pre subtype) and one as claudin-low (CL;CL). Claudin-low tumors represent less than 10% of TNBC consistent with only one in six tumors profiling as this subtype (8,31,32). Increased transcript ratios of post to pre-treatment RSEM transcript abundance (≥2 fold) ranged from 1.7% (Patient 5, referred to as Pt. 5) to 7.8% (Pt. 2) of total expressed transcripts (Fig. 1A). Decreased transcript ratios of post to pre-treatment RSEM transcript abundance ranged from 0.8% (Pt. 4) to 16.1% (Pt. 3). Examination of the tyrosine kinome showed that trametinib induced up to 26% (23 TKs) of the tyrosine kinome (Pt. 2, Pt. 4) among BL;BL patient tumors and in the sole CL;CL tumor, 16% (14 TKs) was upregulated (Fig. 1B). DESeq2 differential expression analysis (33) was used for detection of differentially expressed genes between post and pre-treatment tumors. Focusing on the kinome, four patient BL;BL pretreatment biopsies matched to post-treatment surgical specimens showed overall concordance of the transcriptional response to trametinib, with FRK exhibiting the highest mean increase and BMX exhibiting the highest mean decrease among patients 1, 2, 3 and 5 (Fig. 1C). Patient 4 clustered separately from the other patients with an enhanced immune kinase upregulation, while Pt. 6 responded differently from the five BL tumors."

Bilateral 14 gauge NAc dorsal striatum punches were collected on ice and stored as described above. RNA was purified with RNeasy Micro columns, and Bioanalyzer confirmed that the RNA integrity numbers were >8.0. Total RNA (4 μg) was used for mRNA library construction following instructions of Illumina mRNA sample prep kit (catalog #RS-100-0801). Libraries were created from pooled mRNA samples (n = 4 mice/library and run in independent biological replicates of 3 libraries per sex/stress). Each stage of the estrous cycle was equally represented within all female libraries. All libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 machine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai. Short reads were aligned to the Ensembl Mus musculus NCBIM37 version 67 reference genome using TopHat2 (Kim et al., 2013). Quality assessment revealed an 80%–90% mapping rate, with ∼10% of reads mapping to mitochondrial RNA and <1% aligning to ribosomal RNA. Individual gene counts for each sample were obtained using the HTSeq python package (Anders et al., 2015). Before differential analysis, only genes with >5 reads in at least 80% of samples in any one of the experimental conditions were included. Counts were converted to precision weighted log2 counts per million using the voom transformation, a function of the Bioconductor R package limma (Law et al., 2014; Ritchie et al., 2015). The limma package was used to fit a 2 × 2 factorial design interaction model with stress and sex as main factors to determine the effect of stress in males and in females separately. The same design was used to investigate the effect of Dnmt3a knock-out in stressed males and stressed females with sex and genotype as main factors.

Among them, 1219 mRNA isoforms were significantly upregulated whereas 1373 were downregulated (cut-off: fold change ≥2, P<0.05) (Fig. 6A) in Amh-cKO testes at P4. Further GO enrichment analyses revealed that the upregulated transcripts were mostly involved in RNA processing, RNA splicing or cellular homeostasis (Table 1; supplementary material Table S1), suggesting that Upf2 inactivation disrupts the RNA-processing machinery. This notion was further substantiated by the enrichment of RNA processing-related GO terms in the downregulated transcripts in Amh-cKO testes (Table 1; supplementary material Table S2). In addition, a population of transcripts related to gametogenesis was also observed in the downregulated population in Amh-cKO testes (Table 1; supplementary material Table S2). Given that germ cell development was arrested mostly at the spermatogonial stage in Amh-cKO testes (Fig. 4), these downregulated gametogenesis-specific transcripts most likely result from secondary effects, as the majority are normally expressed at a more advanced spermatogonial stage (supplementary material Table S1).

GAGE, a gene set analysis method that can manage datasets with different sample sizes or experimental designs, was used to perform gene set enrichment tests between pairwise groups of samples [43]. Enrichment tests were performed for custom gene sets extracted from prior literature and for gene sets associated with specific gene ontology (GO) terms [44, 45]. Samples were additionally analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering in R. DESeq2 normalized read counts for all relevant samples were plotted using Graphpad Prism 7 software. RNAseq data from Gomes et al [30] was used for comparative purposes.

A complete set of DEXseq raw counts, normalized counts, and statistics for every exon is provided as Supplementary Table 3 (annotations for each exon are provided in Supplementary Table 4). Summarization of the exons disrupted suggested that SF3B1 depletion leads to multiple categories of alternative splicing including alternative exon skipping (ES), transcript start site, and transcript termination site usage (Fig. ​(Fig.7d).7d). A total of 3840 exons exhibited significant loss or gain, determined by FDR corrected adjusted p value cutoff of 0.01 and minimum log2 fold change >2, which affected 2160 total gene loci (Fig. ​(Fig.7e).7e). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed on exons with sufficient coverage and variance. Replicates in the control and SF3B1 knockdown conditions clustered together tightly, indicating a consistent and predictable deregulation of normal splicing upon SF3B1 knockdown (Fig. ​(Fig.7f).7f). Specific novel alternative splicing events induced by SF3B1 were readily identifiable and ranged from relative simple alternative ES (e.g. Fig. ​Fig.7g)7g) to much more complex patterns. Overall, the alternative splicing analysis revealed wide scale disruption of alternative splicing across the transcriptome."

Short reads alignment was performed with the ENSEMBL Mus_musculus.GRCm38 chosen as the reference genome. The corresponding annotation (ENSEMBL v76) was also retrieved from the ENSEMBL FTP website (http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html). The STAR66 aligner (version 2.4.0b) was used to perform mapping to the reference genome. Alignments were processed with the featureCounts67 function of the Rsubread package, using the annotation file, also used for supporting the alignment. Exploratory data analysis was performed with the pcaExplorer package. Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 package (version 1.18.1), setting the false discovery rate (FDR) to 0.01. The GLM framework of the DESeq2 R68 package was applied, accounting for the sample preparation batch as a confounding factor in the model to increase the detection power. Gene expression profiles were plotted as heatmaps (color-coded z-scores for the regularized logarithm (rlog) transformed batch-corrected expression values.) with the R programming language and the pheatmap package (version 1.0.8). GSEA was performed as described41. Principal component analysis was performed using the pcaExplorer package (V2.5.1)69."

Library preparation was performed using Illumina TruSeq techonology. Samples were processed at UAB Heflin Center for Genomic Science for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or La Jolla Institute (LJI) using the Illumina HiSeq2000 Sequencing System. Reads were mapped to the mm10 genome using TopHat (version 2.0.12) (43). BAM files were sorted using SAMtools (version 0.1.19) (44), and reads were counted for each gene using HTSeq (version 0.6.1) (45) and NCBI Mus musculus Annotation Release 106 (GRCm38.p4). RNA expression was normalized using the rlog function from the DEseq2 R package (version 1.8.2) (46). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DEseq2, and p-values were corrected with the Benjamini–Hochburg procedure. Volcano plots were created using the ggrepel R package. To calculate gene set enrichment, a differential expression probability density function (PDF) was determined for each gene using Quantitative Set Analysis for Gene Expression (QuSAGE) (47). PDFs were combined for each gene set to calculate gene set activity after correcting for gene-gene correlation. Gene set PDFs were compared using Welch’s t-test and p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure."

Since the correlation coefficient itself is affected by sequencing depth (deeper sequencing data leads to higher correlation coefficients; in fact, the depth of IlluminaCAGE data is about one-tenth of HeliScopeCAGE and RNA-seq, as indicated in Supplemental Table 1), we estimated relative standard errors (standard deviation of expressions relative to average expression; square root of the estimated common overdispersion) by using edgeR (Robinson et al. 2010) as a metric of reproducibility performance independent of the sequencing depth. We found that estimated relative standard errors are low (≤10%) for RNA-seq and HeliScopeCAGE, whereas IlluminaCAGE profiles are relatively variable."

De novo genome assembly was conducted using the hierarchical genome assembly process workflow (HGAP, Version 2.3) (15). Then, we found total 91 conflicts between two results by mapping of Illumina sequencing reads to the assembled contigs from PacBio sequencing. Conflicts showed more than 72% frequency for Illumina reads were corrected as Illumina results and others were unchanged as PacBio results, which were verified by Sanger sequencing. Illumina reads were assembled to make the contigs by CLC genomics workbench (CLC bio) and mapped to the two assembled PacBio contigs to expand the sequence of both ends. By using the complete sequence as input, genes were annotated by latest updated version of NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Process (16).

RNA samples were quality controlled and sequenced by the Tumor Profiling Unit of the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR, London). NEB (Hitchin, UK) polyA kit was used to select the mRNA. Strand-specific libraries were generated from the mRNA using the NEB ultra directional kit. Illumina paired-end libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 (Illumina, Little Chesterford, UK) using v4 chemistry acquiring 2 × 100 bp reads. Bcl2fastq software (v1.8.4, Illumina) was used for converting the raw base calls to fastqs and to further demultiplex the sequencing data. The paired-end fastq files were used for further analysis. Tophat2 spliced alignment software was used to align reads to the reference genome (GRCH37) in combination with Bowtie2. Once the reads were aligned, HTSeq-count was used to count the number of reads mapping unambiguously to genomic features in each sample. Differential expression analysis of the count data was done in R using the DESeq2 Bioconductor package. The lists of up- and downregulated differentially expressed genes were then tested for enrichment of gene sets uniquely defining the previously defined CRC subtypes [26] using the Gage Bioconductor package [50].

28772121,deseq2,"After verifying that the Fmr1−/y CA1-TRAP reflects previously reported changes in translation, we performed RNA-seq on six sets of Fmr1−/y and WT CA1-TRAP littermates (see STAR Methods). Hippocampi were isolated from Fmr1−/y and WT littermates at a juvenile age (postnatal days 25–32) when the exaggerated mGluR-LTD phenotype is observed (Nosyreva and Huber, 2006). RNA was isolated from both the TRAP fraction and the starting Input, and samples were processed for RNA-seq according to established protocols (see STAR Methods). Differential gene expression was determined using DESeq2 at the default false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1, consistent with previous studies (Cho et al., 2015, Tao et al., 2016). Our results show that 121 genes are differentially expressed in the Fmr1−/y CA1-TRAP fraction (Figure 1F). The majority of differentially translating transcripts are increased in the Fmr1−/y versus WT (Table S1); however, a significant number are also decreased (Table S2). In contrast to the ribosome-bound TRAP fraction, a comparison of WT and Fmr1−/y Input fractions reveals only three differentially expressed genes (Figure 1F). This is consistent with the observed increase in translation, but not transcription, seen in the Fmr1−/y hippocampus (Muddashetty et al., 2007, Osterweil et al., 2010)."

28993314,deseq2,"In this study, we have demonstrated that Mecp2 regulates tnfa gene expression levels during early zebrafish embryonic development. Even at 6 hpf, when low levels of tnfa expression can first be detected in wild-type embryos, mecp2-null embryos express significantly reduced levels of tnfa. At this time point of development, zebrafish embryos are undergoing epiboly and gastrulation, which initiate formation of the basic body plan. Although we were able to detect the effect of mecp2 deficiency at this early developmental stage in zebrafish embryos, RTT patients do not display phenotypes until at least 6 months after birth. Therefore, we reasoned that the zebrafish embryo could be highly informative regarding the earliest effects of disrupted MECP2-function that ultimately result in disease phenotypes. To assess the genes that are disrupted during early development of mecp2-null, we performed RNA sequencing to reveal whole-transcriptome differences between 6 hpf mecp2-null and wild-type embryos. For the mecp2-null group, embryos were derived from homozygous mecp2-null parents to avoid the confounding influence of maternally deposited wild-type mecp2 RNA. The three biological replicates of each condition clustered closely together after DESEq2 analysis (Fig. 6A). At 6 hpf, 3837 transcripts were significantly upregulated in mecp2-null versus wild-type embryos, whereas 4217 transcripts were significantly downregulated (Fig. 6B). Although the raw counts for tnfa were lower in mecp2-null compared to wild-type embryos, the average number of raw counts for tnfa in wild-type embryos was too low to demonstrate significance (data not shown).

26748710,deseq2,"We evaluated the post-transcriptional gene expression changes of biochemically identified miRNA targets by comparing exonic read changes (Δexon, defined as log2 ExonWT/ExonKO) and intronic read changes (Δintron, defined as log2 IntronWT/IntronKO) between Dicer WT and KO cells. This approach was recently introduced (Gaidatzis et al., 2015) and uses a generalized linear model using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to assess the changes between exonic and intronic reads in the same sample (see Experimental Procedures). Genes with a greater difference between exonic and intronic changes are likely to be altered post-transcriptionally; therefore this metric can be used to assess miRNA-mediated repression of transcripts. mRNAs that are post-transcriptionally repressed by miRNAs will exhibit greater repression at the exonic level compared to the intronic level causing the Δexon-Δintron values of these genes to be negative. As expected, Δexon-Δintron values of genes that are miRNA targets are significantly (p=7.60×10e-107) more negative than non-targets, as depicted in Fig. 2C. This shift confirms the post-transcriptional effect of global Dicer loss on gene expression of direct miRNA targets."

RS-122-2001) (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, http://www.illumina.com). Briefly, poly(A)-containing mRNA molecules were purified from 10 μg of total RNA using poly(T) oligo-attached magnetic beads and then fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under elevated temperature. The cleaved RNA fragments were copied into first-strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II; Invitrogen) and random primers followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis using DNA polymerase I and RNaseH. These cDNA fragments then went through an end repair process using a combination of T4 DNA polymerase, Escherichia coli DNA Pol I large fragment (Klenow polymerase), and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The blunt, phosphorylated ends were treated with Klenow fragment (3′ to 5′ exo minus) and dATP to yield a protruding three-A base for ligation of Illumina's adapters, which have a single T base overhang at the 3′ end. These products were then purified and enriched with 15 cycles of PCR to create the final cDNA library. Some library fragments were further purified to remove the adaptor dimer. Insert plus adaptor and PCR primer sequences of 150–350 base pairs were isolated from 2% E-Gel EX Gel (G4020-02; Invitrogen). The purified DNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation. Libraries were sequenced on the Genome Analyzer and HiSeq 2000 following the manufacturer's protocols.
